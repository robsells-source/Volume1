<p>Many forgeries exist of the first issue: see
http://www.kashmirstamps.com/index.html. Also very dangerous
forgeries are known to exist and this collection area is full of
pitfalls..... Even experts got confused about which stamps are
genuine and which ones are not in the past. Check if a stamp is
not one of the worthless modern 1980's forgeries, which are often
offered as genuine. Then there are watercolor printings, oil
pritings, special printings, a variety of papers (local or
European), unofficial reprints, very dangerous forgeries etc etc.
I think any unused stamp is best considered a reprint unless
otherwise proven. </p>

<p>The 1/2 a stamps have three more or less parallel lines in the
central design. The 1 a has a straigth line with a curved line at
the bottom. The 4 a stamp has a single line in the centre.
Specialists distinguish between watercolors and oilcolors (the
watercolors created problems during the rainy season). These
stamps were handstamped and are thus usually very crudely
executed. Different kinds of papers were used (native papers are
the rarest) and both water based ink (not water resistent!) and
oil based ink were used. Stamps used in Srinagar (Kashmir) have
red cancels. These stamps were valid up to 1878. </p>

At first I did not understand why every stamp had to be issued in
four colors...... D.P.Masson says the first stamps were issued in
black and blue both in Jammu and Kashmir. Later Kashmir used the
rectangular stamps and Jammu continued to use circular stamps,
but now printed in the colors corresponding to those the Kasmir
stamps. </p>

<p>There seems to have been some confusion about the 1 a and 4 a
values, which were initially attributed to the wrong stamps in
earlier catalogues. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="india2/jammuStanleyGibbons.jpg"
width="436" height="612"><br>
Copied from the Stanley Gibbons catalogue 'Stamps of the British
Empire 1912'. Note that the 1 anna and 4 annas values are wrongly
attributed. The 1 anna should have been 4 annas and the 4 annas
should have been 1 anna. Stanley Gibbons apparently only
corrected this error in 1985. The confusion becomes complete when
it is realized that the (real) 4 annas stamp is actually a
reproduction of a Brighton forgery (see Sefi and Mortimer Chapter
XVI, Forgeries; the character just to the left of the
&quot;3&quot; on top looks like a question mark &quot;?&quot;). </p>

I've been told that these are reprints from the original die, I
doubt that this is true though. The design appears to be
mirror-imaged. </p>

<p>I have seen forgeries of these stamps, printed from the
original die. They are different from the so-called Brighton
forgeries made by <a href="treherne.htm">Harold Treherne</a> from
1902 to 1907. These forgeries are rather deceptive. See also
http://www.sspak.com/library/India/Jammu%20&amp;%20Kashmir%20Forgeries.pdf.
<br>
The site http://www.kashmirstamps.ca/SMcontents.html contains
valuable information about these stamps. It is an (improved?)
online version of the book 'T<em>he Stamps of Jammu-Kashmir'</em>
by Alexander Séfi &amp; C.H. Mortimer (1937). Publisher: Séfi,
Pemberton &amp; Co., Ltd., 12 South Molton Street, W.1. London.
322 pp, 59 black &amp; white plates. The forgeries described are
the so-called 'Die I' forgeries (longtime believed to be the
genuine stamps!) and 'Missing Die' forgeries. </p>

<p>'Missing Die' forgeries, believed to be from a 'missing die'
that could not be found in the archive, it later turned out to be
forgeries. These forgeries appear to have been made (and sold) by
corrupt post office officials. Click here for these <a
href="jammufor1.htm">Missing Die forgeries</a>.</p>

<p>I've also heard of reprints made about 1880, which are printed
much better than the originals (the originals are usually
smudgy). Reprints are always in oil colors (never in water
colors).</p>
