<p align="left">Sperati used a few genuine cheap stamps, bleached
out the design (with the cancel remaining intact) and reprinting
it. However, the majority of the forgeries of France made by
Sperati are total forgeries, thus the cancel was also forged. The
paper used by him is very close to the paper of the genuine
stamps. I know that Sperati made forgeries of the 10 c, 15 c, 40
c and 1 F values of the 1849 issue (several 'reproductions'). He
also made forgeries of the 2 c, 4 c, 20 c, 30 c and 80 c 1870
Bordeaux issue. More images of Sperati forgeries (including
tete-beche forgeries) can be found at:
http://www.seymourfamily.com/rfrajola/Sperati/speratiindex.htm
(Richard Frajola). Most of the images shown here have 'SPERATI
REPRODUCTION' in violet printed on the backside together with a
number (of course, Sperati did not sell his forgeries like this,
these marks were applied by the British Philatelic Association).
Source of the distinguishing characteristics: The work of Jean de
Sperati Part IV, 1954 British Philatelic Association. </p>

<h3 align="left">1 F 1849 issue</h3>

<p align="left">Sperati made Reproduction 'A' to 'G' of the 1 F
value. Some of them in several colors as they can be found in the
genuine stamps. Some of these forgeries exist on letters,
complete with forged cancels. </p>

Sperati Reproduction 'A' forgery of the 1 F value. All the above
images are guaranteed Sperati forgeries, they all have the
'SPERATI REPRODUCTION' mark of the British Philatelic Association
on the backside.</p>

Distinguishing characteristics of Reproduction 'A'.</p>

<p align="left">This forgery, type A of the 1 F value, is
extremely deceptive. It exists in several colors and with
different cancels. The distinguishing characteristics are (often
badly visible): there is a white dot in the internal left part of
the 'O' of 'POSTES'. Sometimes a break can be found in the
extreme left of the lower frameline. Pairs of these reproductions
can also be found (often referred to as Sperati type B). The
numeral cancels '805', '1792' and '3472' on some of the above
forgeries were probably also forged by Sperati. Sperati also made
a 'die-proof' in black of this forgery. He also made tete-beche
pairs of type 'A' (often referred to as <strong>Reproduction 'B'</strong>,
sorry no image available yet). </p>

Sperati Reproduction 'A' on an envelope, the cancel 'PARIS 22
JUIN 49 (60)' is also forged by Sperati. The backside of this
envelope shows Jean de Sperati's signature and the violet
'SPERATI REPRODUCTION' seal of the British Philatelic
Association. </p>

<p align="left">A similar forged letter can be found at
http://www.seymourfamily.com/rfrajola/Sperati/sfrance.htm. There,
an additional forged cancel 'BORDEAUX 26 OCT. 59 (32)' was added
to the letter.</p>

<p align="left">Many <strong>cancels</strong> can be found on
Reproductions 'A' and 'B':<br>
Towncancels:<br>
'BLETTERANS 1 MARS 1849 38'<br>
'BOYNES 21 OCT. 1850 (43)'<br>
'CREPY 10 JANV. 1849 (58)''CHARTRES 5 JANV. 1849'<br>
'EPINAL 29 DEC 49 (82)'<br>
'LA LOUPE 5 JANV. 1849 (27)'<br>

Various numeral cancels: '166', '481', '805', '854', '1675',
'1730', '1792', '1818', '1896', '2199', '2250', '2273', '2642',
'2733', '2962', '3317', '3273', '3383', '3472'. Some of these
cancels might be genuine cancels, since Sperati sometimes used
bleached out genuine stamps to print his forgeries on, with the
genuine cancel remaining intact. <br>
<br>
Other cancels might exist</p>

Front page of an auction catalogue of Robson Lowe with Sperati
forgeries (1972), with an envelope with two 1 F Ceres stamps,
send to Bavaria. It bears three 'ORLEANS 2 JANV 1849 (23)' forged
cancels. The cancel 'ERLANGEN 10 1' is also forged. </p>

Reproduction 'C' of the 1 F value in two different colors. This
forgery is always cancelled with the Paris Star cancel. </p>

'Proof' of this cancel, reduced size</p>

<p align="left">Type C reproduction of the 1 F Sperati forgery
can be easily distinguished due to the fact that always the same
cancel was used. This cancel is always placed at the same
position. Often parts of another stamp to the left and/or right
can be found in this type C forgery. A white dot can be found in
front of the first 'S' of 'POSTES'. </p>

has the same cancel)</p>

'Proof' of the constant cancel used on 'Reproduction D' of the 1
F value. </p>

<p align="left">The above Sperati forgery is often referred to as
'Reproduction D', the star cancellation is always the same and
located in the same position for every forgery (this is an easy
way to detect this forgery). Sperati produced this forgery in a
pair (the other stamp not shown here). Other distinguishing
characteristics are: there is a white dot behind the 'B' of
'REPUB' and white dots before and after the 'R' of 'FRANC'. There
is also a white dot between the 'O' and 'S' of 'POSTES'. I've
also seen this forgery as a die-proof with the cancel extended
towards the right hand side of the die-proof. </p>

alt="Single stamp in orange color." width="170" height="199"><br>
Sperati forgery, Reproduction 'E'; a pair of 1 F stamps with
constant cancel and a single stamp in orange shade.</p>

<p align="left">The above pair of Sperati forgeries is referred
to as Reproduction 'E'. The cancel is always on the same position
(an easy way to recognize this forgery). Sometimes parts of
stamps above this pair are still visible (as in
http://www.seymourfamily.com/rfrajola/Sperati/FRA09a_300.jpg, but
not in the above example). I've also seen single stamps of this
forgery and forgeries of this type in orange colors (see second
image). A die-proof exists of the right hand side forgery, where
the cancel (as mentioned always in the same position) has been
extended on the proof at the left hand side (this forgery is
often referred to as <strong>Reproduction 'F'</strong>). </p>

Sperati forgery type G of the 1 F value</p>

<p align="left">Sperati's type G of the 1 F was only issued in
the orange Vervelle shade. The design is rather blur on this
forgery. A minor white spot can be discovered below the 'U' of
the word 'REPUB'. Otherwise, this forgery is very deceptive. </p>
