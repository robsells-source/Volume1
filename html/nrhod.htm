up in Southern and Northern Rhodesia in 1924. Northern Rhodesia
became a protectorate. Both Rhodesia's were joined with <a
href="nyasa.htm">Nyasaland</a> in 1953 to form the federation of
Rhodesia and Nyasaland which was dissolved in 1963. Northern
Rhodesia became the independent and was renamed Zambia on 24th
October 1964.</p>
