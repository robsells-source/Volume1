<h3 align="left">10 c value 'REPUB FRANC'</h3>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'A' has some minor spots in the 'PO'
of 'POSTES'. Also, a horizontal scratch can be found in the last
bottom 'C' extending towards the right bottom square.
Reproduction 'A' has a numeral cancel '898' and circular date
cancels. Apparently, this cancel is always in the same position
(sorry, no image available yet). See under Reproduction 'C' for
uncancelled forgeries. </p>

So-called Reproduction 'B' has a constant numeral cancel '2235'
(always in the same position) with which it can be easily
identified. It also exists with '2273' cancel (see right image)</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'B' has a scratch in the design
below the 'U' of 'REPUB'. It was sometimes, but not always
cancelled with a constant numeral cancel '2235' (see above).
However, other cancels exist: the numeral cancels '1128' and
'2273'. Unused Reproductions 'B' also exist. </p>

src="franc2/speratifor2.jpg" border="0" width="216" height="230"></a></p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'C' is actually Reproduction 'A',
but with the cancel removed. There are some flaws due to this,
for example in the right hand border halfway up. It also exists
as a black 'die-proof' (see image above). </p>

<h3 align="left">20 c value 'EMPIRE FRANC'</h3>

Front and backside of a tete-beche pair of 20 c Sperati forgeries</p>

<p align="left">This reproduction of two 20 c tete-beche stamps
only exists uncancelled. Distinguishing characteristics of the
left stamp: some small white dots can be found between the
letters 'E' and 'M' of 'EMPIRE' and after the 'F' of 'FRANC'.
Distinguishing characteristics of the right stamp: a white dot
appears behind the 'P' of 'EMPIRE'. This forgery is very
deceptive. Luckily, only one genuine pair of 20 c tete-beche
uncancelled stamps exists. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">1 F value 'EMPIRE FRANC'</h3>

<p align="left">Here some Sperati reproductions of the 1-franc
stamp of the 1853 issue are shown. They was produced by Jean de
Sperati, the &quot;Master Forger&quot; and first appeared in
1947. His forgeries are very dangerous. Sperati made fifteen
different reproductions of this stamp. Sperati used a
photo-lithography technique to produce his forgeries. The
reproductions A, B, D, H and I can also be recognized by their
cancellations, which is always 'constant' that is, placed in the
same location. Several black 'die-proofs' were also made by
Sperati. </p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'A' always has the same mute Paris
Star cancel.</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'B' has the constant cancel '924'
and can thus easily be recognized as well (sorry, no image
available yet). </p>

Sperati forgery referred to as reproduction 'C' in the British
Philatelic Association's Sperati book. </p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'C' is extremely deceptive. There is
a small scratch through the lower part of the first 'S' of
'POSTES'. Also, sometimes a white spot at the upper right part of
the right '1'. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratitypeD4.jpg"><img

src="franc/frsper1.jpg" alt="Sperati forgery! Reproduction 'D'"
border="0" width="185" height="234"></a><br>
Reproduction 'D' with constant cancel</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'D' has a 'constant cancel', meaning
that the cancel on this reproduction is always the same and is
always in exactly the same place on the stamp. Sperati copied a
genuine cancelled stamp, and his reproduction process reproduced
both the stamp and the cancel. It has been handstamped 'Sperati
Reproduction' on the reverse by the B.P.A.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratitypeE5.jpg"><img

border="0" width="175" height="201"></a> <br>
Sperati Reproduction 'E'.</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'E' has a rather large break in the
outer frameline, just before the upper left corner ornament. A
much smaller break can be found in the upper right hand corner.
There are some very small white dots in front of the first 'E' of
'EMPIRE'. Another microscopic dot can be found after the 'F' of
'FRANC'. I presume that the above cancels '295A' and '698' are
genuine cancels obtained by removing the design of cheaper
genuine stamps and replacing it by the image of a 1 F stamp.</p>

Sperati Reproduction 'F'</p>

<p align="left">This forgery is extremely deceptive. There are
some small weaknesses in the lower frameline. I have seen
Reproduction 'F' with an apparently genuine numeral cancel
'2273'. </p>

Sperati Reproduction 'G'</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'G' has a white spot below the 'A'
of 'FRANC'. Otherwise, this forgery is extremely deceptive. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc/speratih.jpg"><img
src="franc/speratih.jpg" alt="Sperati forgery, reproduction 'H'"
border="0" width="172" height="193"></a><br>
Reproduction 'H', with constant numeral cancel '..73'.</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'H' always has the same numeral
cancel, with the last numbers '73'. </p>

Reproduction 'K': a pair of 1 F stamps</p>

<p align="left">I don't find the distinguishing characteristics
given by the British Philatelic Society very helpful.
Nevertheless, the above Reproduction 'K' is definitively a
Sperati product. The right hand side stamp is supposed to have
been based on Reproduction 'F'. Flaws, other than mentioned by
the BPS seem to be constant for both pairs shown above. </p>

Tete-beche Sperati forgeries; Reproduction 'L'</p>

<p align="left">In the left stamp of Reproduction 'L', a
tete-beche pair, there is a very small white dot between the
letters 'R' and 'A' of 'FRANC'. The right hand side stamp has a
some disturbance below the 'FR' of 'FRANC. This forgery is
extremely deceptive and the distinguishing marks are very hard to
see. In the second forgery shown above, Sperati used the numeral
dot cancel '3383'. On the site:
http://www.seymourfamily.com/rfrajola/Sperati/FRA27_300.jpg, a
continuous grill cancel can be seen applied to Sperati's
Reproduction 'L'. I've also seen the cancel '1734' being used on
Reproduction 'L'.</p>

<p align="left">A tete-beche forgery pair Reproduction 'L' on an
envelope, apparently all cancels have been forged as well (this
appears to be the cover illustrated in the British Philatelic
Association work). The cancel 'ANVERS 17 JANV. 54 5S' is listed
there under Belgium:</p>

src="franc2/speratifor3b.jpg" border="0" width="375" height="231"></a></p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'M' consists of three 1 F stamps
with one inverted 1 F in the middle. They have the same flaws as
Reproduction 'L'. </p>

Reproduction 'M'</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">5 F value</h3>

<p align="left">The forger <a href="sperati.htm">Sperati</a> also
seems to have made forgeries of the 5 F stamp (five varieties;
among them three 'proofs'). They are not very common and quite
valuable. </p>
