<h1 align="center">GUERNSEY</h1>

<p>Bisected (diagonally) 2 p stamps were used before the issue of
the Guernsey local issue, due to a shortage of 1 p stamps on the
island; this was done from 27 December 1940 to 22 February 1941. </p>

banknote paper that gives it a bluish background color. </p>

<p>These stamps were printed by the Evening Post. In the 1 p
value there are four tiny &quot;A&quot;s in the design, one in
each corner. The 1/2 p has &quot;A A B B&quot; in the corners. At
the bottom of the sheet the text &quot;EVENING POST, JERSEY.
17/3/41.&quot; can be found on the 1 p stamp and &quot;EVENING
POST JERSEY JANUARY 1942&quot; on the 1/2 p value (see image
below). I've seen a full sheet of 60 stamps of the 1 p value (10
rows of 6 stamps). These stamps remained valid until 13 February
1946. </p>

<p>An enormous amount of first day covers (1st April 1941) seems
to exist. The following text from a local newspaper might explain
this (see
https://www.jerseybunkertours.com/post/the-road-to-liberation-1st-april-1941)<em><br>
&quot;JERSEY'S NEW STAMP<br>
BIG RUSH FOR FIRST DAY'S ISSUE.<br>
There was an extremely heavy demand to-day for the first issue of
Jersey's penny stamps. The Head Post Office had a full counter
staff and there was an endless flow of purchasers throughout the
morning, many requests being made for full sheets of sixty. The
large table in the center of the office, the telegram desks and
all other available space was taken up by persons assidiously
sticking the stamps on to envelopes already addressed, these
enthusiasts apparently being keen on posting and securing the
first day postmark&quot;</em></p>

<p>This stamp was issued in 1915 in the prisoner of war camp of
Knockaloe on the isle of Man. The stamps was intended to serve on
letters between the different prisoner camps on the island
(25.000 German prisoners were on the island). The stamps was
issued and forbidden by the authorities on the same day. All
stamps except a few were burnt (only the above letter, a sheet of
21 stamps in the museum of Man and 9 stamps have survived). The
above letter was recently offered on Ebay (October 2003).</p>

<p>Another picture of a Knockaloe stamps can be found at the
following website of Sandafayre:
http://www.sandafayre.com/gallery/stamp_3037.htm. </p>

<p>Of course, forgeries exist of this rare stamp, in the next
forgery, the word 'FAUX' (=forgery) has been added at the bottom
of the stamp: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/knockfor1.jpg" width="355"

<p align="left">I have also seen this forgery without the words
'FAUX' printed at the bottom. These forgeries appear to be modern
reproductions. </p>
