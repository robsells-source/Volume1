<p align="left">This stamp exists in red, blue, black, green and
violet, however only this stamp in black and black on yellow were
issued in 1853 in Camden N.Y. There seem to be several types.
Other colours are probably reprints. </p>

<p align="left">I've seen another rather primitive forgery (made
by <a href="taylor.htm">Taylor</a>?), which has a rather white
head and different lettering (for example, the &quot;J&quot; of
&quot;JENKINS&quot; is very squeezed).</p>

<p align="left">Another stamp was issued with the inscription
&quot;JENKIN'S One Cent DESPATCH&quot;, the status of this stamp
is not yet determined. Example of this stamp:</p>

<p align="left">I've been told that the next stamp is a bogus
issues made by <a href="scott.htm">Scott</a>, it has the
inscription &quot;JONES CITY EXPRESS POST&quot; and the head of
Washington, the value is 2 c black on lilac:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/scottforgery.jpg" width="216"

(Scott forgery)</p>

<p align="left">There exists another bogus design, resembling the
above Scott forgery, but with the head of an Indian in the
center. The text reads &quot;JONES CITY EXPRESS POST&quot;. I've
been told it was made by the forger Taylor. I've only seen the
values 2 c red on blue, 2 c black on yellow and 2 c red on grey.
On the 2 c black on yellow forgery, the head of the Indian is
tilted more backwards. </p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="kidders"></a>KIDDER'S CITY EXPRESS
POST</h1>

<h3 align="left">Kidder's City Express Post (1847, New York)</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/siegel20.jpg" width="232"
height="163"><br>
(Genuine, image obtained from a Siegel auction)</p>

<p align="left">The only stamp issued was a black on blue stamp
in 1847, with a manuscript &quot;IS&quot; control mark. The
company was founded by Henry A. Kidder and then taken over by the
brothers Isaac C. Snedeker and George H. Snedeker in 1851 (hence
the initials &quot;I S&quot; I presume). It continued doing
business until 1853. <br>
Hussey made reprints of these stamps, which were sold by Scott.
The reprints were printed in sheets of 10 (5 x 2) and have
constant flaws and can thus be recognized. Reprints were also
made by new owner G. H. Snedeker just after 1851 when he
purchased this local post from H.A.Kidder (the reprints were done
in various colours on green paper). </p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/kiddhussrep1.jpg" width="441"
height="801"><br>
Minisheet of 10 <a href="unitehus.htm">Hussey</a> reprints</p>

<p align="left">The Hussey reprints are always in black on green
and are quite common. Main distinguishing characteristics of the
10 reprints (see image above)<br>
Position 1 (top left of the sheet): Second &quot;S&quot; of
&quot;EXPRESS&quot; is connected to bottom frameline. Some
typical blotches in the word &quot;KIDDER'S&quot;<br>
Position 2 (top right of the sheet): Frameline at top right
partly missing (nex to the flower). <br>
Position 3 (second row, left stamp): Frameline above
&quot;R&quot; of &quot;KIDDER&quot; broken. <br>
Position 4 (second row, right stamp): Upper frameline almost
totally missing. Some breaks can be found in the frameline to the
right of &quot;CTS&quot;. <br>
Position 5 (third row, left stamp): ?<br>
Position 6 (third row, right stamp): Piece of frame missing next
to right hand side flower.<br>
Position 7 (fourth row, left stamp): Left outer frameline is too
thick. <br>
Position 8 (fourth row, right stamp): Below &quot;2 C&quot; the
frameline is broken. A straight line goes through this
&quot;2&quot;. <br>
Position 9 (fifth row, left stamp): ?<br>
Position 10 (fifth row, right stamp): First &quot;E&quot; of
&quot;EXPRESS&quot; thick. </p>

<h4 align="left">First forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="usa2/kidderfor2.jpg"><img

<a href="usa3/kiddersfor11.jpg"><img src="usa3/kiddersfor11.jpg"
border="0" width="245" height="174"></a> </p>

<p align="left">This forgery has an inverted &quot;S&quot; of
&quot;KIDDER'S&quot;. It exists in various colors: black on red,
black on lilac, black on blue, black on yellow, red on green, red
on orange, red on blue, black. The man on the horse wears a hat
instead of a cap. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/kidde1.jpg" alt="1847"
width="265" height="219"><br>
Similar forgery (man with hat), but with the 'S' corrected.
Possibly made by Benson(?), it also exist in many bogus colors.</p>

<h4 align="left">Second forgery (Taylor?)</h4>

src="usa/us93l1.jpg" width="235" height="172"></p>

<p align="left">The word 'CITY' is too smal on these forgeries,
such that the 'Y' of 'CITY' is placed very far from the 'E' of
'EXPRESS'. I've also seen this forgery in the color blue and
black on grey.</p>

<h4 align="left">Third forgery</h4>

<p align="left">Another forgery, very closely resembling the
second forgery seems to exist (I have never seen it, but it seems
to have an inverted &quot;S&quot; of &quot;KIDDER'S&quot;). </p>

<p align="center"><a href="usa3/kidders3001.jpg"><img
src="usa3/kidders3001.jpg" border="0" width="247" height="180"></a><br>
Could this be the third forgery? </p>

<h4 align="left">Fourth forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/kidd4.jpg" width="211"
height="154"></p>

<p align="left">There is a break in the inner frameline above the
&quot;2&quot;. The rider is wearing a cap with a very short front
part. </p>

<h4 align="left">Fifth forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="usa3/kiddersfor10.jpg"><img
src="usa3/kiddersfor10.jpg" border="0" width="232" height="174"></a></p>

<p align="left">This forgery has no dot below the &quot;s&quot;
of &quot;Cts&quot;, but the &quot;t&quot; of this word does. The
&quot;R&quot; of &quot;KIDDER'S&quot; has a long foot. The tail
of the horse is rather rounded. </p>

<p align="left">These stamps were issued in 1844, the design with
the sitting woman exist in black on lilac and black on green. The
design with the man with sword and flag exists in black on lilac
or black on red (with slightly different design). The only cancel
I have seen consist of a penstroke. Bisected stamps are known to
exist. This stamp seems to have been used in a number of cities.</p>

<p align="left">Probably forgeries, note that the design and
letters are different from the genuine stamps:</p>
