<p align="left">The forger Peter Winter (Germany) made forgeries
of many classic and rare stamp of several countries in the
1980's. They sometimes have the word 'replik' written on the
backside (but not always). He not only sold them 'loose' but also
on cover. He seems to have used some photographs of the British
Library in London to make some of his forgeries (source:
http://www.sheryll.net/Forgeries/Germany/Forgeries_article_Germany.htm).
A catalog exists of the 'House of Stamps', offering his 'stamps',
see:
http://www.seymourfamily.com/billclaghorn/HouseOfStamps/index.htm.
Recently, these forgeries are offered in large numbers on
internet auctions for low prices.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Note on all Winter forgeries:They are
printed on modern paper (the paper doesn't 'look' old). This is
the main distinghuishing characteristic.</strong></p>

(Peter Winter forgeries of the eagle issue of 1889)</p>

<p align="left">He has also made forgeries of at least the 10 p
and 20 p values of the 1889 eagle issue of Germany. As in the <a
href="germacol.htm">Fournier</a> forgeries, the horizontal and
vertical perforation does not match. I have also seen imperforate
forgeries of the 10 p and 20 p values (I have even seen a
complete sheet of 5 rows of 9 imperforate 20 p stamps and a
similar sheet with 10 p perforate stamps). He seems to have used
these stamps mainly to create the <a href="kiaut.htm">rare
provisional overprints</a> (see above) used in China and possibly
also some German colonies overprints. He also made some
'misperforations' (I have seen a misperforated 20 p stamp). I've
also seen a imperforate 10 p red tete-beche (large space in
between) with a 20 p red (wrong colour!).</p>

<p align="left">I have seen Winter forgeries of the 5 M
reichspost 1900 issue of Germany. I've only seen them with a
cancel of 'Titisee' (but other cancels might exist) or
uncancelled.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa2/winter3.jpg" width="211"
height="268"></p>

<p align="left">Airmail stamps of Germany were also forged by him
.Both stamps with 'E.E.L.P.' overprint and the one with 'Gelber
Hund' have been forged. In all his forgeries that I have seen,
the word 'COPY' is printed at the bottom of the stamp. I have
also seen a postcard with one of these forgeries:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa2/gerairrepl4.jpg" width="398"
height="264"><br>
(Forged postcard adressed to: 'Walter Kunath Leipzig C1
Humboldsstrasse 2a')</p>

<p align="left">The position of the stamp, cancels and adress
varies from forgery to forgery. </p>

(Forgery of a 'Photo-Papiere Satrap' label attached to a 10 p
Germania stamp)</p>

<p align="left">Peter Winter also made forgeries of other
advertisement labels, I have seen: 'Aquadent Ferd. Jacob',
'Appetitanregend Lecin' and 'Gewerktschaft Quint' (all attached
to a 10 p Germania stamp). </p>

(A forgery of West Saxony, issued just after the end of World War
II, Peter Winter also made a forgery of the 6 p black, without
Russian inscription)</p>

<p align="left">Please note, that Peter Winter has made many more
modern forgeries of Germany (of the period 1920 onwards); among
them the Zeppelin stamps, the first issues of West Germany etc.
etc.</p>
