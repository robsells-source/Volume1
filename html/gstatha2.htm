<h4 align="left">Hamburg is a Free City of the Hansa in the north
of Germany. Besides the official issues for <a
href="gstatham.htm">Hamburg</a> there also exists numerous local
issues.</h4>

<h1 align="center">The so called 'Hamburger Boten' institute
issues:</h1>

<p>C.Hamer, H. Scheerenbeck, W. Krantz, Th. Lafrentz and Ch. van
Diemen. Most of these stamps were only issued for stamp
collectors. Forgeries have been made in large quantities of these
stamps, I am not sure if the stamps shown here are genuine.
Probably most of them are forgeries!</p>

<pre>
  1/2 black on coloured paper
</pre>

<p>One reprint and nine kinds of forgeries are known.</p>

<p>Distinghuishing characteristics of the genuine stamps:<br>
1) There are 35 pearls around the central circle. <br>
2) There is a stop after the word &quot;BOTEN&quot;.<br>
3) There is a stop between &quot;&amp;&quot; and &quot;Co&quot;.<br>
4) the &quot;C&quot; of &quot;Hamer&quot; doesn't have a top
serif<br>
5) the &quot;&amp;&quot; is very close to the pearls above it.</p>

<p>If my information is correct, the reprints show a line
connecting the &quot;&amp;&quot; to the circle with pearls.</p>

src="germa2/hambot2.jpg" width="209" height="210"> <br>
(Spiro forgeries)</p>

<p align="left">This forgery has only 30 quite large pearls
around the central circle (should be 35) and no stop behind the
word &quot;BOTEN&quot;. The dividing line of the 1/2 is more
horizontal than in the genuine stamps. I have seen this forgery
in the colours: black on grey, black on yellow (shades), black on
lilac (shades), black on violet, black on green (shades) and
black on blue (shades). </p>

<h4 align="left">Second forgery (could also have been made by <a
href="spiro.htm">Spiro</a>):</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa2/hambot7.jpg" width="188"
height="180"> <img src="germa3/hamerfor2b.jpg" width="204"
height="186"> <a href="gstat3/hambHamer1.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/hambHamer1.jpg" border="0" width="210" height="199"></a></p>

<p align="left">This forgery has 33 uneven pearls. There is a
vertical line through the &quot;A&quot; of &quot;HAMBURG&quot;.
The &quot;C&quot; of &quot;C.Hamer&quot; has an upper serif as
well as the &quot;C&quot; of &quot;Co&quot;. The dot between the
&quot;&amp;&quot; and &quot;Co&quot; from the genuine stamps is
missing. The &quot;H&quot; of &quot;Hamer&quot; is very narrow.
Misprints seem to exist of this forgery with a missing central
stroke of the &quot;E&quot; of &quot;BOTEN&quot;. I have seen
this forgery in the colours: black on grey, black on yellow
(shades), black on green, black on blue (shades) and black on
lilac. </p>

<h4 align="left">Third forgery made by <a href="scott.htm">Scott</a>
(the same one from the catalogue!)</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa5/hambScott1.jpg" width="409"
height="208"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/hamerscott.jpg" width="233"
height="116"><br>
(Reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">In this forgery the '2' is slanting backwards.
There are only 33 pearls in the central circle. I have seen this
forgery in the colours: black on lilac, black on orange, black on
blue (shades), black on violet (shades), black on grey and the
bogus colour red (see picture above). </p>

<p align="left">Scott made album pages of Hamburg, it has eight
empty spaces for this issue. The first space has the above
forgery printed in black (with the above distinguishing
characteristics). The other empty spaces indicate the colors
'orange', 'violet', 'green', 'mauve', 'blue', 'flesh' and 'buff'.
Such a page was send to me by Peter Brinkman (Australia).</p>

<h4 align="left">Fourth forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/hamerfor4.jpg" width="118"
height="118"><br>
(Reduced size)</p>

<p align="left">In this forgery the &quot;&amp;&quot; is placed
quite far from the pearls above it. There are 35 pearls as in the
genuine stamps. The dot which should be below the &quot;Co&quot;
is placed between the &quot;C&quot; and &quot;o&quot;. The word
&quot;INSTITUT&quot; is placed too far to the left. I have seen
this forgery in the colours black on grey, black on yellow, black
on brown and black on green. </p>

<h4 align="left">Fifth forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/hamerfor5.jpg" width="114"
height="118"><br>
(Reduced size)</p>

<p align="left">There are 33 pearls in this forgery. The
&quot;C&quot; in front of &quot;Hamer&quot; is very broad. </p>

<h4 align="left">Sixth forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/hamburgHamer2.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/hamburgHamer2.jpg" border="0" width="908"
height="530"></a></p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/hamerfor6.jpg" width="237"
height="119"><br>
(Reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">This forgery has 34 pearls. The &quot;C&quot; in
front of &quot;Hamer&quot; has a long curved top. There is a
white outline around the &quot;&amp;&quot; which touches the dot
behind it. </p>

<h4 align="left">Seventh forgery</h4>

<p align="center">(Sorry, no pictures available yet)</p>

<p align="left">There are 35 pearls in this forgery. The
&quot;&amp;&quot; has a dot in its lower half. There is no dot
behind &quot;C&quot;. The &quot;Ha&quot; of &quot;Hamer&quot; is
placed slightly higher than 'mer' of this same word. The bottom
of the letters &quot;amer&quot; are joined by a continuous line. </p>

<h4 align="left">Eight forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/hamerfor8.jpg" width="252"
height="122"><br>
(Reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">This forgery has 32 (uneven) pearls. The word
&quot;INSTITUT&quot; is placed slightly to the right hand side
when compared to a genuine stamp. There are no dots behind
&quot;C&quot; (before &quot;Hamer&quot;) and &quot;&amp;&quot;. I
have seen this forgery in the colours black on lilac, black on
blue, black on grey, black on green and black on yellow. The
&quot;2&quot; is slanting very much backwards (more than in the
Scott forgeries). </p>

<h4>Ninth forgery, bogus issue</h4>

<p>A bogus issue exists in black on various colours, the
inscription reads (in English!) &quot;POST PAID 1/2 C. HARMER
HAMBURG BOTEN INSTITUTE&quot;:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa5/harmer1.jpg" width="624"

<p align="left">The stamp forger <a href="taylor.htm">S.Allan

&quot;HARMER&quot; as well. </p>

<h4>Envelopes</h4>

<p>Examples (cut from envelope): </p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/hamengen.jpg" width="280"
height="150"><br>
(Genuine envelope cuts)</p>

<p align="left">I have seen these cuts in various colours such as
blue, red and red on yellow. I presume the only genuine ones are
issued in red colour. Genuine envelopes have a thick
&quot;.&quot; behind &quot;HAMB&quot;. At least 5 different kind
of forgeries exist (some also with embossing and on complete
envelopes), examples of forgeries: </p>

(4 other kind of forgeries)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa4/hamerfor1.jpg" width="161"

Possibly forgery made by Scott; I've also seen this forgery in
the color blue. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="germa5/hamer1.jpg"><img

Forgery: &quot;C&quot; in front of &quot;HAMER&quot; slanting too
much. Belt different etc. </p>

<p>A bogus value 1 Sch also exists:</p>

</div>

<p align="left">One reprint and four forgeries are known. All
stamps printed in colour on white paper are forgeries. </p>

<p align="left">In many of the genuine stamps, there is a line
just below the &quot;H&quot; of &quot;HAMBURGER&quot; towards the
central oval (this characteristic is not always present
though....). The &quot;G&quot; of &quot;HAMBURG&quot; and the
&quot;Z&quot; of &quot;KRANTZ&quot; have shading behind them. The
bar in &quot;1/2&quot; should be horizontal (and not slanting).
In most genuine 1/2 Sch stamps, there is a stop behind the word
&quot;HAMBURGER&quot; (however sometimes this stop is missing). </p>

<h4 align="left">First forgery (made by <a href="spiro.htm">Spiro</a>):</h4>

<p align="left">Both values seem to have been printed on the same
sheet by Spiro, 5 columns of 5 stamps with 1 Sch stamps seperated
by a 15 mm gutter followed by 5 columns of 5 stamps of the 1/2
Sch value. </p>

<p align="left">The letters &quot;BU&quot; of &quot;HAMBURG&quot;
are too small. </p>

<p align="left">Spiro also made forgeries of non-existing colours
(coloured stamps on thick white paper). I have seen the following
colours: 1/2 Sch yellow (shades), 1/2 Sch green (shades), 1/2 Sch
grey, 1/2 Sch brown, 1/2 Sch red, 1/2 Sch orange, 1/2 Sch blue
(shades), 1/2 Sch violet, 1 Sch yellow (shades), 1 Sch green
(shades), 1 Sch grey, 1 Sch brown, 1 Sch red (shades), 1 Sch blue
and 1 Sch violet.</p>

<h4 align="left">Second forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa/krantz1.jpg" width="498"
height="416"></p>

<p align="left">The &quot;H&quot; of &quot;HAMBURGER&quot; is
placed nearer to the inner ellipse than in the genuine stamps.
There is less shading behind the &quot;G&quot; of
&quot;HAMBURG&quot; and the &quot;Z&quot; of &quot;KRANTZ&quot;.
This forgery was also printed in bogus colours: yellow, orange,
brown, violet, green, red and blue (all in several shades). </p>

<p align="left">I have seen a souvenir sheet with many forgeries
printed by Goyen Pass, Dauphine 7, Paris with an explanation on
the backside. I presume the forgeries (20 stamps) are the above
described forgeries. I do not know if the printer of this
souvenir sheet was also the producer of the forgeries. </p>

is no bar in the &quot;1/2&quot;. The 1 Sch has an extra rose
pattern under the &quot;A&quot; of &quot;KRANTZ&quot;. These
forgeries also exist in colour on white or coloured paper. </p>

<p align="left">Scott made album pages of Hamburg, it has twenty
(11 for the 1/2 sch and 9 for the 1 sch) empty spaces for this
issue. Two of the empty spaces has the above forgeries printed in
black (with the above distinguishing characteristics). Such a
page was send to me by Peter Brinkman (Australia).</p>

been replaced. </p>

Genuine?</p>
<div align="left">

<pre>  1 Sch metallic on coloured paper
  1 Sch metallic on white paper
  2 Sch metallic on coloured paper
  2 Sch metallic on white paper</pre>
</div>

<p>There seem to be two types of these stamps. Furthermore
four(?) kinds of forgeries exist.</p>

<p>The genuine stamps are printed in metallic ink (gold, silver
or copper) on coloured paper or white paper. They have two
rozettes in the side borders which have a squarish shape. The
Queen's head does not touch the upper border. The head and neck
are thin. The face cannot be recognized. The foot enters the left
bottom value box. In the 2 Sch value the &quot;2&quot; in the top
left corner is smaller. </p>

<h4>First forgery (made by <a href="spiro.htm">Spiro</a>)</h4>

<p>The 1 Sch and 2 Sch forgeries made by Spiro are different from
each other in several aspects. In both values the Queen's head
almost touches the label above it. In most cases of the 2 Sch,
the second &quot;A&quot; of &quot;HAMONIA&quot; has a downwards
line at the left hand side. </p>

<p>1 Sch:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="germa/hamon1.jpg"><img
src="germa/hamon1.jpg" border="0" width="167" height="192"></a> <a
href="germa/hamon2.jpg"><img src="germa/hamon2.jpg" border="0"
width="161" height="189"></a> <img src="germa/krantz4.jpg"
width="161" height="191"> <img src="germa2/krantz4.jpg"
width="172" height="190"> <a href="germa5/krantz3007.jpg"><img
src="germa5/krantz3007.jpg" border="0" width="168" height="198"></a></p>

<p>The &quot;H&quot; of &quot;HAMONIA&quot; almost touches the
frame left to it. The Queen has a thick head and neck. </p>

<p>2 Sch:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/krantz1.jpg" width="174"
height="194"> <a href="germa/hamon3.jpg"><img
src="germa/hamon3.jpg" border="0" width="175" height="193"></a></p>

<p>The inscriptions are smaller in the 2 Sch Spiro forgery,
especially the word &quot;HAMONIA&quot; is much smaller than in
the genuine stamps. The neck, head and arms are very thick. </p>

<p>Spiro printed these stamps in sheets consisting of a block of
5x5 1 Sch stamp at the left hand side and another block of 5x5 2
Sch values at the right hand side. In the middle there is a 14 mm
wide gap between the two blocks. </p>

<p><strong>Second forgery</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong><img src="germa3/krantzfor2.jpg"
width="399" height="130"><br>
</strong>(Reduced sizes)</p>

<p>The foot of the Queen does not enter the value label. The
figures of value are quite thin. I do not know who produced this
forgery. </p>

<h4>Third forgery 'reprint'</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/hambrepr1.jpg" width="368"
height="277"><br>
(Reprint of 1978 for the Nordposta exhibition, reduced sizes)</p>

Zoom-in on the 1978 reprint</p>

<p align="left">This 'reprint' was made for the Nordposta
exhibition in 1978, it shows a minisheet with a 2 p gold on blue
stamp together with two stamps of the 'Stadtbriefbeforderung
Hamburg'. The text reads &quot;EUROPA IM RATHAUS&quot;.</p>

<h4 align="left">Fourth forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="germa5/hambKrantz2.jpg"><img
src="germa5/hambKrantz2.jpg" border="0" width="375" height="221"></a></p>

<p align="left">The right hand top side of the &quot;W&quot; of
&quot;W.KRANTZ&quot; has an upwards extension. In this forgery
type I've seen:<br>
1 Sch: red on blue, green, blue, orange, brown on yellow, light
brown, lilac, red on grey, grey on lilac. <br>
2 Sch: red on blue, green, blue, grey on lilac, red. </p>

<h4>Bogus issues of Krantz</h4>

<p>Unlisted design of W.Krantz (bogus issue by <a
href="taylor.htm">Taylor</a> of Boston USA)</p>

height="237"> <br>
(Bogus issue of Krantz, note that the 'N' in 'KRANTZ' is inverted
in the2 Sch value)</p>

<p align="left">Many colours exist, I have seen (partly with
inverted &quot;N&quot; in &quot;KRANTZ&quot;): 1 Sch black on
blue, 1 Sch black on grey, 1 Sch black on lilac, 1 Sch black on
violet, 1 Sch blue, 1 Sch green on blue 1 Sch brown, 2 Sch black
on yellow, 2 Sch black on blue, 2 Sch black on red, 2 Sch black
on violet, 2 Sch black on orange, 2 Sch blue and 2 Sch green on
blue. This design is rather similar to a Russian Zemstvo stamp of
Korcheva.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/krantz5.jpg" width="871"

Other fantasy design made by <a href="taylor.htm">Taylor</a>,
sitting woman in the harbour, inscription &quot;Hamonia von W.
Krantz Hamburg FRANCO&quot;, This design seems to have been
copied from an Italian label, where the design is the same, but
the text reads &quot;AMMINISTRAZIONE DELLE POSTE ITALIANE&quot;
(see Volume 2 of the Stamp Catalogue). </p>

<p align="left">I have also seen the colour black on lilac in the
above bogus design. </p>
