<hr>

<p>Jeffreys (George Kirke) was a forger in the late 19th century
(London). According to 'Philatelic forgers, their lives and
works' (by Varro E. Tyler), his name is also sometimes spelled
as: Jeffreyes, Jeffries or Jeffryes. He made some forgeries of
overprints of various countries and forgeries of the following
countries: Ceylon, Grenada, New South Wales, New Zealand,
Tasmania and Victoria. Finally he made two bogus stamps of
Hawaii. If anybody has more information about these forgeries,
please contact me! More information about Jeffreys himself can be
found at:
http://www.ukphilately.org.uk/bpt/whowaswho/whowaswho-ijk.htm. He
seems to have collaborated with the stamp dealers Alfred Benjamin
and Julian Hippolite Sarpy (<a href="benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a>
and Sarpy), who sold many of his products in their shop.</p>

<p>In 1892 Jefrreys was convicted to six months imprisonment with
hard labour for 'conspiracy to defraud the public' for his stamp
forging activities (see next text). </p>

<p>GEORGE FREDERICK CLAYTON. I am a postman, in the employ of Her
Majesty's Postmaster-General, and live at 25, Hazelwood Crescent,
Westbourne Park&#151;I have known Jeffreys since 1841, and have
seen him in possession of <font color="#FF0000">Sandwich Islands </font>stamps;
he told me he got them from Ponsford and Co.&#151;these (<i>produced</i>)
are &quot;the Sandwich Islands stamps; they all have what appear
to be postmarks on them, and are gummed to some paper&#151;they
are perforated&#151;when I first saw them in Jeffreys' possession
they were not gummed, perforated, or post-marked&#151;I saw him
gum and perforate some of them&#151;I have never sold any of
these stamps; I received some of them from Jeffreys, I did not
purchase them; I had lent him £3, and he told me I might have
them and sell them to get my money back&#151;I did not sell them
myself, but through others to Sidney Swann, and not more than
half a dozen to Mr. Buhl&#151;I sold from fifty to a hundred, and
got about £5 or £6 for them&#151;there is no value attached to
them&#151;no such stamp ever existed in the Sandwich Islands as
far as I know&#151;I afterwards saw Mr. Buhl, and returned him
some of the money he had paid for them, and I procured some of
the stamps without a post-mark and gave them to him&#151;I have
been to Jeffreys house, 80, Grove Road, Bow, about four times; in
1886 or 1887, and saw him put a <font color="#FF0000">surcharge
on some Costa Rica </font>stamps with a small printers press and
type&#151;I have known Benjamin and Sarpy about the same time,
and saw them together at one time in the same year very
frequently&#151;I have sold stamps for them which were genuine to
the best of my belief; I do not suppose they were always
genuine&#151;I sold them to Mr. Buhl and others&#151;I met
Jeffreys and Benjamin in 1889 in Benjamin and Sarpy's shop, 1,
Cullum Street; he showed me some Tasmanian stamps, and said that
they were the latest&#151;I said that they were very good
forgeries&#151;I saw Sarpy put a <font color="#FF0000">fourpenny
surcharge on a Grenada fiscal stamp</font> in his shop&#151;he
did it with a small metal die; Benjamin was in the shop&#151;I
have seen perforating machines there; these (<i>produced</i>) are
three of them, and I sold them a small printing press, No. 1
Model, large enough for printing visiting cards or stamps.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. JONES. The firm had these
Sandwich Islands transactions with Jeffreys about August, 1886; I
was three days or a week dealing with the stamps&#151;there is no
such stamp as this&#151;the Sandwich Islands stamp is nothing at
all like it, either in size or impression&#151;I saw the original
pen-and-ink sketch on paper from which these stamps were made
before the stamps were printed; Jeffreys showed it to me and told
me he had got them printed, so that I knew perfectly well that
they were not genuine&#151;I did not sell it as genuine&#151;I
gave no warranty with the stamps I sold&#151;I sold some other <i>faked</i>
stamps knowing that they were <i>faked</i>, but if the people
asked me if they were genuine I should have told them no&#151;I
let them rely on their own judgment&#151;I made a little
collection&#151;there are a great number of <i>fakes;</i> the
proper term is <i>fac similes</i> I also know that there are
reprints; the process I saw at Jeffreys' was for type, not for
stone&#151;I took my money out of the £5 or £6, and handed the
balance to Jeffreys.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. WILLIS. This (<i>produced</i>) is
the press I sold to Sarpy; it is broken now, as it was when I
sold it&#151;it would not stand much use in the state it is in;
it would become worse&#151;I have taken an interest in collecting
stamps since 1886&#151;I got into the service of the Post Office
in 1890, and have been in their service nearly two years&#151;I
was an office boy in Threadneedle Street when I first began to
take an interest in stamps&#151;after that I was steward on board
a boat, and occasionally in the employ of the Post Office, and
eventually altogether&#151;a great many lads of twelve to sixteen
sell stamps, and people do a considerable trade in it&#151;there
are a great many stamps which are not genuine&#151;I knew
Jeffreys by the name of the <i>faker</i> before I became
acquainted with him, sometime before 1886; I cannot say whether
it was so far back as 1891&#151;I knew he produced stamps which
were not genuine&#151;I first saw Benjamin in the Stamp Market,
Bell Alley, London&#151;that is a place where all the boys
congregate to buy and sell stamps&#151;a dozen or more would
congregate there when Benjamin was round&#151;I have seen other
persons buy besides Benjamin&#151;the last time I sold stamps was
to Benjamin and Bannister&#151;I cannot bring to memory selling
any for Benjamin and Sarpy&#151;I only knew the firm as Benjamin,
but I knew Sarpy at that time&#151;I sold one large lot of
genuine stamps for Benjamin and Bannister&#151;the majority, if
not all, were genuine&#151;Mr. Buhl never complained, he never
came to me in that transaction at all&#151;I never heard that any
of those I sold were not genuine&#151;a lot of people buy <i>fakes</i>
knowing them to be such&#151;I heard Mr. Phillips say that there
are people who possess albums full of stamps which do not profess
to be genuine&#151;there always were a lot of dealers who bought
stamps knowing they were wrong, and I have bought some
myself&#151;<font color="#FF0000">the Sydney View</font> is a
very pretty stamp; it gives a view of the bay&#151;;<i>fake</i>
stamps are sold for a small price compared with the
genuine&#151;there are stamps so rare that only two or three of
them are in existence, but I have never seen them&#151;I believe
that when the genuine stamp cannot be obtained people frequently
buy <i>a fake</i> stamp.</p>

<p><i>Re-examined.</i> They buy them because they are
sold&#151;the dealers are the people who would buy <i>fake</i>
stamps&#151;I have seen Benjamin and Sarpy in the stamp market;
the boys buy and sell and exchange them, and <i>fake</i> stamps
would be bought, sold, and exchanged&#151;I have sometimes got
the genuine price for the forged stamp&#151;I did not seek
Jeffreys out because people called him the <i>faker</i>&#151;I do
not think <i>fac similes</i> are always marked as such; you can
tell them by their appearance; if it is done so that you cannot
distinguish them from the original they ought to be marked&#151;I
believe this press can still do a little printing.</p>

<p>SIDNEY SWANN. For the past two or three years I have done
nothing, owing to my failing sight, but three years ago I was a
dealer in foreign stamps&#151;I met Jeffreys in 1886, and he
offered me a little money if I would take two plates and a sketch
to an engraver named Ponsford&#151;I did so; these (<i>produced</i>)
are something like two of the stamps&#151;I was to order 1,000 of
each, and give Jeffreys' name, and I did so&#151;Mr. Clayton
afterwards gave me some of the stamps, and told me to sell them
for him&#151;I do not Know how many there were, but 50s. or 60s.
was given for them&#151;I sold them to Mr. Buhl&#151;I gave the
money to Mr. Clayton, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. JONES. I think it was in the
middle of the day that Jeffreys gave me the sketch&#151;he had
not got the plate.</p>

<p>THOMAS HENRY PONSFORD. I am a printer and engraver, of 60,
Little New Street, City&#151;on August 18th, 1886,1 got an order
to engrave two steel plates, 5 by 4, according to a
sketch&#151;1,000 were to be printed from each plate, one in blue
and one in carmine&#151;the name given was G. K. Jeffreys, 80,
Victoria Park Road&#151;the engraving was to be £3 15s., and the
printing £1 9s.&#151;I executed the order; I forget whether it
was delivered or called for&#151;the stamps produced are what I
engraved&#151;when they left my premises they were not marked in
this way; they were in a large sheet, but not perforated or
gummed&#151;I did not know for what purpose they were intended.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. JONES. I do not remember the
person who brought the sketch&#151;I do not recognise
Jeffreys&#151;they called more than once&#151;I think it was the
same person each time&#151;I do not recognize Swann&#151;the
second call was to give me directions as to colour, and after the
plate was done there were inquiries about the printing&#151;80,
Grove Road was the address given me.</p>

<p>ALBERT FELSENTHAAL. I am a dealer in foreign stamps, and have
traded under the name of Lester, 101, Green's Road&#151;I first
knew Benjamin about six years ago, and Jeffreys and Sarpy five
years ago&#151;I was at Jeffreys' house and saw him surcharge
some stamps of the <font color="#FF0000">Argentine Republic</font>&#151;he
stamped them with the word &quot;<font color="#FF0000">official</font>&quot;&#151;I
may have had a dozen, or perhaps two dozen, after he had
surcharged them&#151;I showed them to various dealers; I don't
remember the result; I did not want them, hut he forced them on
me&#151;he gave them to me in exchange&#151;he gave me a piece of
paper with surcharges on it; he termed them the faker's
pride&#151;I should say they were very good, and very likely to
deceive; likely to be taken for genuine&#151;I saw him frequently
at Benjamin and Sarpy's business premises at Cullum Street, and
soon after Benjamin returned from Australia in 1888, and I once
met Jeffreys in Bishopsgate Street&#151;Benjamin was nearly
always at Cullum Street when I saw Jeffreys there; and during the
latter part of the time, 1890 and 1891, Sarpy has been
there&#151;the three always transacted their business at the
back, and we had to go out; I was outside, but not on all
occasions&#151;I have seen money pass, principally on Saturdays,
in 1889 and 1890&#151;in 1890 Benjamin said he was going to <i>fake</i>
forgeries, and there was plenty of money to be got out of
it&#151;he told me once that he and Sarpy had been at Jeffreys'
house all night surcharging stamps&#151;I have sold stamps for
Benjamin and Sarpy since his return from Australia down to six
months back; they were mostly forgeries&#151;they were good
imitations&#151;I sold some as forgeries to Mr. Buhl; he was my
principal customer; I sold them nearly all to him, saying what
they were&#151;I sold the others to dealers since this case
began; they, of course, would sell again&#151;I remember selling
Mr. Buhl a forged stamp as a genuine one once by accident, and
once by design&#151;I got the full value, and nothing was said; I
simply sold it for 3s.&#151;in all other cases I told him they
were forgeries&#151;in the other instance the Mump was given by
Benjamin as genuine&#151;the stamps I sold to dealers were such
good imitations that they would deceive dealers&#151;I once took
some fiscal stamps to Jeffreys, and asked him to clean them,
meaning to remove the ink marks; he said he had not been doing
anything in that line lately, it was trifling business and lie
had better things than that&#151;I asked him how to clean them;
he said he could tell me if I did not mention it to any one, and
wrote out on a bit of paper the description how to clean various
coloured stamps, and gave it to me&#151;the stamps were all of
low value; he asked if I had any £5 or £10 stamps to let him
have them in exchange for the receipt for cleaning, which I
kept&#151;this is it (<i>This mentioned salts of lemon and other
chemicals</i>); he said that the four articles at the bottom were
the principal acids he used.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. JONES. I got that at Jeffreys'
house on Sunday, November 22nd, 1891&#151;that was the second
time I had been there&#151;I had not made an appointment to go
there&#151;I was in communication at that time with Detective
Mozer, as regards the prosecution&#151;I went there to collect
evidence, not as a spy&#151;I gave the document to Mozer the
following day&#151;I kept it twelve hours&#151;no one else was
present when he gave it to me&#151;I said nothing before the
Magistrate about his asking me for some higher value stamps in
return, but I told Mr. Mozer&#151;I did not ask him on my first
visit to put this surcharge on&#151;I had from ten to twenty-four
of these&#151;that is the only transaction I had with
Jeffreys&#151;I mean to say that I saw Sarpy in Jeffreys' shop in
1891; we have played at cards together after business hours in
1890, but not in 1891.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. WILLIS. I have done business in
the City as a stamp-dealer six and a half years&#151;I have no
office; I go to my father's office, Bury Court, St. Mary
Axe&#151;I buy stamps from housekeepers and waste-paper
dealers&#151;I do my business at home&#151;I have several
customers at the Exchange in the street&#151;I do my business in
the street&#151;I buy them, and take them away with me and sell
them to dealers&#151;I bought a lot hero last night&#151;I have
no other business&#151;I know the principal dealers in the City
and West-end&#151;I have known for a good many years that stamps
are being sold which are not genuine&#151;I know the term &quot;<i>fake</i>&quot;;
it means stamps which are not genuine&#151;I have only bought
stamps of Benjamin and Sarpy on two or three occasions, and quite
recently; the first time was about seven or eight months
ago&#151;I know they have been dealing for some time in stamps
which are not genuine; Benjamin did so a few months after I knew
him, five and a half years ago&#151;I first went to 1, Cullum
Street when Benjamin returned from Australia in 1888&#151;I knew
Benjamin and Bannister, but that was not at Cullum Street&#151;I
first visited Benjamin in Leathersellers' Buildings and Bell
Alley about six years ago; I did not know then that he dealt in
stamps which were not genuine, but I knew it a few months
afterwards&#151;I visited him almost every day down to his coming
to Cullum Street, but the first time I bought any of him was
about seven months ago&#151;I actually sold him my stamps four or
five years before I bought any of him, and I knew the whole of
the time that he dealt in stamps which were not
genuine&#151;since his return, in 1888, I have seen him do the
work which made them pass as if they were real&#151;I did not see
them in his shop, but I knew he dealt in them by being told so by
people&#151;we all used to go to a public-house together and play
at billiards, and I learned the fact from conversations in his
place&#151;certain people who dealt in forgeries were
present&#151;I first knew that any person was a maker of these
things when I visited Jeffreys' house five or six years
ago&#151;about seven months ago I bought stamps of him which I
knew were not genuine, and I have done so, I should say, three
times since&#151;I bought them as forgeries so as to keep in with
them that they should not suspect me&#151;I had seen Mr. Mozer at
that time, but I did not tell Benjamin that I came at Mozer's
instance&#151;Benjamin would sometimes give me forgeries, and say
that they were genuine; I did not know that all were forgeries,
sometimes he said that they were forgeries and sometimes genuine,
and the genuine ones turned out to be forgeries; but they were
genuine in one or two instances&#151;I have heard of people
getting stamps into their possession which they believe to be
genuine, but are not, and I know of one instance&#151;in some
instances forged stamps are purchased for the purpose of testing
the genuine ones; many dealers have been taken in by
them&#151;when I was told that stamps were not genuine, I always
sold them as such&#151;I always sold them to dealers, principally
to Mr. Buhl; I have sold him fifty and a hundred which I was told
were not genuine, and he has bought them for detection&#151;he
asked where I got them, and I told him from Benjamin and
Sarpy&#151;I have sold them to two other dealers as not being
genuine; they would have bought them as genuine, but I told them
they were not; I either said they were <i>fakes</i>, or
forgeries&#151;stamps which have been marked are subjected to
treatment and the marks removed, but they are not sold openly by
dealers to my knowledge&#151;I bought one number of <i>The Stamp
Collectors' Monthly</i>&#151;I have heard the name of Cheveley,
Wilson, and Co.&#151;stamps from which the ink marks have been
taken out have been sold to be taken as unused&#151;<i>fakes</i>
have been sold to Continental dealers in large numbers&#151;a <i>fac
simile</i> is not a stamp which could be used&#151;I do no know
whether they are advertised in France, Germany, and America; I do
not study catalogues.</p>

<p><i>Re-examined.</i> As to cleaning stamps the ink marks would
be taken out, and they would be used as new stamps; I have seen
an instance of it&#151;there is a considerable trade with the
Continent&#151;<i>fac similes</i> are wonderfully good
imitations; they are outright forgeries, they are printed from
the original plate which is no longer in use, and has been sold
by Government.</p>

<p>OTTO DANNENBERG. I am a clerk out of employment&#151;in 1891 I
was in the employ of Mr. Hart, a stamp dealer in
London&#151;Jeffreys called on him, and I heard a conversation in
reference to some Sydney View stamps, which Hart bought at 3s.
each; a genuine one is worth 20s. to 30s.&#151;Jeffreys said he
had sold Benjamin a quantity of them, and we were not to say
anything about it, as he had told Benjamin he would not sell any
within a certain period&#151;that was in June, 1891&#151;I saw
Jeffreys two or three days later at his house, 80, Grove Road.
Bow, and asked him to bring some more <font color="#FF0000">Sydney
Views </font>for Mr. Hart&#151;he was in his shirt-sleeves, and
said he was engraving a die, and just left off to see me&#151;he
had a graving tool in his hand&#151;he showed me some impressions
from a die for an <font color="#FF0000">eightpenny Ceylon </font>stamp
and two pieces of star water-mark paper&#151;he said that
Benjamin and Hart had agreed to go partners in the profit, but,
having fallen out, Jeffreys had to pay for the whole of the
papers&#151;he did not show me the die; he said he did not keep
them on the premises; he had a place which no one knew but
himself.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. JONES. The star water-mark paper
was a foot square&#151;I have not seen other pieces that size
before&#151;I do not know how wide apart the stars were&#151;this
was in the evening&#151;I went down for Jeffreys to call on Mr.
Hart I do not know whether Hart is in this country&#151;I have
sold <i>fakes</i>, both in this country and abroad; I sold them
as genuine on the Continent, but not in this country&#151;the
imperfect eightpenny Ceylon impression was on cardboard, I
think&#151;the head was in.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. WILLIS. I have known Benjamin
about seven years, and Sarpy three or four years&#151;about two
years ago I saw a card of their business, which said that they
sold <i>fakes</i> of all descriptions&#151;I also saw a <font
color="#FF0000">1s. 9d. Ceylon stamp</font>, and a <font
color="#FF0000">blue Tasmanian</font>&#151;Mr. Hart bought one,
but they were not well enough executed to take people in&#151;I
have seen, perhaps, 100 <font color="#FF0000">Queensland</font>
stamps not genuine&#151;they came from Mr. Hart; who got them
from an <i>employ</i>é of the Bank of Queensland&#151;Mr. Hart
cleaned and marked some <font color="#FF0000">New Zealand</font>
stamps&#151;the business has been going on about three
years&#151;I believe this (<i>produced</i>) is Benjamin and
Sarpy's card, which I saw two years ago.</p>

<p><i>Re-examined.</i> I did not make a very accurate observation
of the card&#151;it said, <i>&quot;Fakes</i> of all descriptions
Supplied on the shortest notice, or something of that
kind&#151;the eightpenny Ceylon stamp was not finished, he was in
the course of engraving it&#151;the man at the Bank of Queensland
did not supply them, with any knowledge of forgery&#151;first of
all Jefferys supplied Mr. Hart with stamps which were known to be
forged&#151;I had some stamps from Benjamin and Sarpy; they were
forgeries, and known to be such&#151;the stamps supplied by the <i>employ</i>é
of the Queensland Bank were half-crown, ten shillings, and one
pound postal and fiscal&#151;they were perfectly
genuine&#151;besides the three prisoners a man named Bannister
supplied forged stamps to Mr. Bart, who bought them and sold them
to collectors as genuine.</p>

<p>HUBERT GRIEBERT. I am a stamp dealer, of 135, Fenchurch
Street&#151;I have had a shop next door to Benjamin and Sarpy for
nine months, and have done business with them&#151;I have been in
their shop in Cullum Street many times, and have seen blocks of
wood on the counter&#151;I do not know what they were used
for&#151;I have bought stamps for them&#151;in May, 1891, I
bought two <font color="#FF0000">Sydney View </font>stamps as
genuine for £2 the two&#151;I afterwards sold them, and a
complaint was made about them&#151;I went to the customer and
paid him back the money he had paid me, and received the stamps
back&#151;I afterwards saw Benjamin, and told him they were
forged, and asked him to return me the money I had paid&#151;he
said he bought them for genuine, and did not know when he sold
them to me that they were not genuine&#151;as far as I remember
he returned me the value of the £2 in other stamps in exchange,
but I kept the two stamps&#151;he did not ask me to give them
back&#151;I did not believe they were forgeries, but I said
nothing to him to that effect&#151;in August, 1891, I went to
Benjamin's shop, and bought three <font color="#FF0000">Baden
kreuzer</font> stamps for fifteen shillings the three, which was
a fair price assuming them to be genuine; if they were not they
would be worth nothing; about a week afterwards I found that they
were forgeries, and went to Benjamin's shop; he was not there,
but I saw Sarpy and asked him to return me the money; he said he
did know anything about it and asked me to wait&#151;I waited,
and about three weeks afterwards I went again and Benjamin
returned me 12s. out of the 15s. I had paid&#151;he said he
bought them for genuine, I returned them&#151;after my attention
was called to them I noticed that the <font color="#FF0000">8 in
&quot;18&quot;</font> was different from the original.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. WILLIS. I have been in this trade
about six years and have known of these non-genuine stamps being
dealt in during that time&#151;I have bought collections from
people in a respectable position and thought all stamps in my
possession were genuine, but they were not&#151;I paid £2 for
the Sydney Views&#151;I know the word <i>fake</i>&#151;I have
bought what I know to be forgeries twice or three times in
Benjamin's shop&#151;I cannot tell you the number; they were for
myself and my customers; I gave them away to my customers to show
that they were forged; I gave away ten or fifteen like
that&#151;these <i>fakes</i> are made abroad, and sold in sheets,
240 stamps for a halfpenny&#151;I know that Benjamin sold
non-genuine stamps sometimes&#151;I once went to him to ask him
to surcharge stamps about eight months ago&#151;I had a lot of
genuine stamps in my possession, and I wanted to protect myself
and my customers against these forgeries&#151;<font
color="#FF0000">the stamps he surcharged were Portuguese and
Madras and Azores</font>&#151;I kept about ten of them, and gave
away five or six&#151;I think I was in the shop while they were
being done&#151;I rook seventy or eighty <font color="#FF0000">Orange
Free State fiscal stamps to Benjamin to have them cleaned and
post-marked</font>&#151;I was to pay thirty shillings&#151;they
belonged to somebody I knew&#151;I cannot tell you his name, I
did not take it&#151;he knew Benjamin, but did not want to go
into his shop, and he got me to go&#151;I suppose he was a
dealer&#151;I returned them to him&#151;I was to have thirty
shillings profit, and I told him Benjamin would charge thirty
shillings&#151;Benjamin said I was to take the Baden stamps at
fifteen shillings, but if I took them back as <i>fakes</i> he
would return me twelve shillings&#151;I said, &quot;Are they
forgeries?&quot;&#151;he said, &quot;No; but if they come back I
will give you twelve shillings for them&quot;; and he did
so&#151;I have only been in England eighteen months&#151;I first
saw the card of Benjamin and Sarpy about six months ago; one of
them gave it to me&#151;I did not see any of them lying about in
the shop&#151;Mr. Phillips employed me about seven months ago to
try and buy the whole stock-in-trade of Benjamin and Sarpy; he is
the secretary of the <i>Philatelical Journal</i>, and the
prosecutor in this case&#151;he told me it was a very good
stock&#151;it would not have been worth buying if they were all
forgeries&#151;Benjamin asked me £1,700 or £1,800&#151;I
examined the stock very roughly, and formed the opinion that it
was a good stock, and told Benjamin and Sarpy that before I could
proceed with the purchase, the person for whom I was buying must
see the stock without their being present, and they declined to
allow that&#151;I have no doubt that Mr. Phillips was really
desirous of purchasing the stock&#151;he asked me whether I
thought they would recognise him if he went to inspect it
disguised, but I think he only meant fun&#151;I looked at the
stock&#151;I thought it was not quite worth the money asked for
it&#151;I thought it was worth about £1,200 or £1,300&#151;they
were genuine stamps&#151;I understood the £1,700 was for the
whole of the business, at least Benjamin said we could have all
the stamps they had in possession&#151;I don't know whether they
showed me all the stamps.</p>

<p><i>Re-examined</i>, My estimate was rough; I had only twenty
minutes to value them&#151;I had not then seen any
forgeries&#151;I cannot give you the date, Philatelical Society,
or a special notice that they would not be answerable for the
genuineness of any stamps bought at their establishment&#151;I
have had stamps repaired for me, when the perforation was cut I
had it mended; I had some where the perforation was only on three
sides, and <font color="#FF0000">got Sarpy to put a perforation </font>on
the fourth side&#151;that would make them more valuable if the
stamp was not damaged; it would only increase the value very
slightly&#151;that would not be <i>faking</i> unless it was
perforated afterwards altogether&#151;I sometimes asked them to
let me see their latest <i>fake;</i> they did not always show
it&#151;I am called the artful man&#151;I have sometimes sold
stamps to Benjamin&#151;I have got five or six stamps perforated.
<i>lb-examined.</i> They were genuine stamps&#151;their business
card was not generally available&#151;the work was done in the
shop, and they would talk to a respectable collector, and
sometimes to inferior dealers; if a stranger came in everything
was kept quiet&#151;I never read any notice there about forged
stamps.</p>

<p><i>By the</i> COURT. The stamps I had perforated on the fourth
side were for my own private collection, not to sell&#151;I am in
the habit of exchanging stamps, like most collectors; I did not
exchange these, they are still in my <i>collection</i>&#151;the
fourth side had been perforated, but had been accidentally cut
off.</p>

<p><i>By</i> MR. WILLIS. Enough paper was left at the edge of the
stamp to have the perforation done&#151;they are old stamps, and
are valuable&#151;in some of the Colonies many years ago the
stamps next to the edge were without perforation; if I got one I
should have it perforated, that it might be complete&#151;that
was not the case with my five or six stamps; I believe the
perforation had been cut off them, but there was ample room for
another.</p>

<p>JULIUS CYRIAX. I am one of a firm of manufacturing chemists,
of 16, Coleman Street, City&#151;I was a collector of stamps for
some years up to 1890&#151;I knew Benjamin, in partnership with
Bannister, in Bell Alley&#151;I bought a number of stamps from
them up to about 1886&#151;I think £300 would cover the whole I
paid them&#151;I paid them £70 for the first pick out of a large
collection&#151;then I bought post-office used stamps&#151;I had
them examined by experts&#151;stamps were purchased out of the
collection shown to me&#151;I wrote to Benjamin&#151;he came and
saw me in November, 1890&#151;I told him some stamps which he had
shown me had been pronounced doubtful, and insisted upon his firm
taking them back, and refunding me the money&#151;he assured me
the postal-marks were perfectly genuine; but they agreed to pay
me back £100, the amount I paid for them&#151;half was repaid me
in January, 1890, and the other in January, 1891&#151;I received
a letter from Mr. Buhl in 1886, enclosing this cheque for £25.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. WILLIS. I first bought in 1882
from Benjamin&#151;I had seen Benjamin and Bannister together,
and thought they were partners&#151;I purchased good stamps prior
to the £70 parcel&#151;the parcel they paid me back I purchased
in 1884, 1885, and 1886&#151;I took them back in 1890&#151;the
doubt was about the postmark&#151;I don't know Sarpy&#151;I have
collected stamps since 1880&#151;I have known of false stamps
since 1880&#151;I have had doubtful stamps from other
dealers&#151;I cannot fix the number; they were not of
importance&#151;I have had them mostly from Continental dealers.</p>

<p><i>Re-examined</i>, If the stamps had not been cancelled they
would have been worth more than I paid for them&#151;they were
fiscal stamps of £3, £4, £5, and £6 unused&#151;if postmarks
bad been put upon them other than by the Post Office in Australia
they would be worth nothing.</p>

<p>DOUGLAS MACKENZIE I am employed by my brother, a &quot;West
Indian merchant in the City&#151;I have been a stamp collector
sixteen years&#151;for three years I have known Benjamin and
Sarpy, and Jeffreys some time before that&#151;I have
occasionally written for the <i>Philatelical Journal</i>&#151;I
have been interested in finding out particulars about
forgeries&#151;I have visited Benjamin and Sarpy's shop
frequently for the purpose of finding out and tracing
forgeries&#151;they have boasted to me about their
forgeries&#151;they mentioned the <font color="#FF0000">Sydney
View and Ceylon</font>&#151;they said <font color="#FF0000">Jeffreys
had manufactured the St. Vincent surcharged fourpenny and
shilling stamps</font>&#151;either Benjamin or Sarpy showed those
to me&#151;I have seen <font color="#FF0000">dies for postmarks,
perforating machines, and the star watermark paper</font>&#151;Sarpy
showed me the paper&#151;he said they had it specially
made&#151;he afterwards showed me the stamp printed on
it&#151;that was a Ceylon forgery&#151;he said it was to be sold
in Paris as genuine&#151;I bought a sheet of the <font
color="#FF0000">1s. Victoria blue stamps</font>&#151;I passed it
on to Mr. Buhl&#151;they were forgeries&#151;they were sold to me
as forgeries&#151;I bought Ceylons and Sydney Views&#151;I have
them here&#151;I inquired for the card, &quot;<i>Fakes</i>
supplied on the shortest notice&quot;&#151;I got it from
Sarpy&#151;he took it from his pocket, and said, &quot;This is
the latest <i>fake&quot;</i>&#151;that was in October,
1890&#151;I asked him to let me have one; he said, &quot;No; I
cannot do that&quot;&#151;he finally sold me one for 5s.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. JONES. I have brought all the
stamps but the 1s. Victorian&#151;there were twelve on the
sheet&#151;I have not seen the blue sheet&#151;I do not know how
close the stars are, but I should judge by the stars that are
printed on them&#151;I am not responsible for the article in the <i>Philatelical
Journal</i> as to the mania for collecting stamps in 1872.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. WILLIS. I gave the card to the
police&#151;it was published in Mr. Buhl's <i>Stamp News</i> in
November, 1890&#151;I did not tell the prisoners I was going to
publish the card&#151;I did not ask their permission to publish
it&#151;I did not say I was going to sell them&#151;I had the
intention to publish it when I bought it&#151;they did not say,
&quot;Very well, you shall pay us 5s. for it&quot;; they
positively declined to let me have it&#151;no such thing was
mentioned&#151;I have been in communication with Mr. Buhl for
five years&#151;I have given him Victorians, purchased at
Benjamin and Sarpy's&#151;I have spent some time there; I used
often to go in at lunch-time as I passed the shop&#151;I have
seen them perforating and postmarking the stamps&#151;they
postmarked a railway ticket for me&#151;it is in Court, I
believe&#151;I have known of the prisoners having non-genuine
postage-stamps since 1890&#151;I have been to their shop before
1890, but I never knew of the forgeries before&#151;in 1890 they
explained matters to me occasionally&#151;they have told me to
get rid of my West Indian stamps, because they should be making
some&#151;I have bought forged stamps of them&#151;about
half-a-dozen times since 1890&#151;I knew they had forged stamps
in their possession, although I had not bought any before
1890&#151;I know persons have bought forged stamps, not for
collecting, but for comparison&#151;I thought the stamp paper I
saw was taken off the margin of a sheet, till Sarpy told me he
had it made.</p>

<p><i>Re-examined.</i> I did not tell the prisoners I was in the
habit of writing in stamp journals.</p>

<p>PERCY MAY BRIGHT. I am a stationer, bookseller, and dealer in
stamps, at the Arcade, Bournemouth&#151;about 23rd November,
1891, I called at Cullum Street, and bought some stamps from
Benjamin, for about £2, as genuine&#151;I took them to
Bournemouth&#151;next morning I examined them critically&#151;I
found <font color="#FF0000">a twelve kreutzer adhesive Bavarian</font>
was a forgery&#151;I had paid 6s. 6d. for it&#151;I paid for them
separately&#151;I sent it to Mr. Phillips by post&#151;on the
23rd November I saw some stamps in Benjamin's shop
window&#151;that or the next time I saw a <font color="#FF0000">V.
R. Englis</font>h&#151;I do not think there was more than a week
between my two visits&#151;the label I saw attached to it was
&quot;Rare V. R.&quot;&#151;that was not genuine&#151;the black
one (<i>produced</i>)&#151;I could tell by looking; the top
letters were let in&#151;I had seen similar stamps with the
letters printed over; if genuine, its value would be £6 to £8,
according to condition&#151;the one I saw was of no value&#151;I
was induced to pay 6s. 6d. for it because I believed it was
genuine.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined.</i> I had known Phillips some time&#151;he
did not suggest my going to this shop&#151;I have considerable
doubt if he knew it, because I do not think I mentioned it to him
or wrote to him&#151;I believe I saw him the morning I
went&#151;I cannot recollect whether I told him I was
going&#151;my impression is I did not&#151;I sent the card to
Phillips because I am a member of the same association of which
he is secretary&#151;I had heard of Benjamin and Sarpy's before I
went there&#151;I advertise in the <i>Stamp News</i>&#151;I take
it in&#151;I do not think I saw advertised in it, in November,
1890, &quot;<i>Fakes</i> of all descriptions&quot;; I have the
journals for reference&#151;I did not expect to buy forged
stamps&#151;I had done business with them once or twice
before&#151;I believe I saw the rare stamp after I got outside,
not before I went in&#151;I did not examine it in the shop, there
was not sufficient light&#151;a twelve kreutzer, said here to be
worth 15s., I have advertised at a guinea&#151;I did not go there
by arrangement with Phillips.</p>

<p><i>Re-examined.</i> 15s. to a guinea would be the retail
prices, according to whether the stamp was fine or poor.</p>

<p>THEODORE BUHL. I am a stamp dealer, of 11, Victoria Street,
City&#151;some five years ago, when Benjamin was in partnership
with Bannister, I bought some <font color="#FF0000">1s. Vincent
vermilion surcharged 4d. stamps</font> from that firm&#151;I
bought three for 45s., from Benjamin or Bannister, as
genuine&#151;that was a fair price if genuine&#151;within a day
or so I found the surcharges were forgeries, and I wrote to
them&#151;I then had an interview with them&#151;after I
threatened to take steps against them they admitted they were
forged, and returned the money&#151;a short time afterwards I
purchased from Clayton or Swann these supposed <font
color="#FF0000">Sandwich Islands stamps</font> (<i>produced</i>);
I paid 50s. for them&#151;I think it was 26th August, 1886&#151;I
thought they were genuine new issued stamps that I had not yet
seen&#151;I found there were no such stamps in the Sandwich
Islands, and they were bogus&#151;they had postmarks on
them&#151;I saw Clayton, and told him the stamps were bogus, and
he agreed to return the money paid for them by
instalments&#151;he returned 2s. on two occasions&#151;I have
seen Jeffreys about half-a-dozen times&#151;I dealt with him in
1882 or 1883&#151;I have known Benjamin about ten years&#151;I
have had a good many dealings with him&#151;I have known Sarpy
about eight years&#151;from 1883 onwards I bought a good many
stamps and other things, believing them to be genuine&#151;I
dealt with Benjamin and Bannister first, and then with Benjamin
and Sarpy&#151;fiscal stamps with postmarks on them&#151;I bought
of them last about four years ago&#151;a good many I have sold
believing to be genuine, a good many are bad, the Post Office
said they were&#151;I have seen Benjamin and Sarpy about them at
Cullum Street&#151;I received this sheet of twelve blue Victoria
stamps from Mackenzie, which I handed to the
detective&#151;Mackenzie made a statement to me as to whence he
had got it&#151;they are forgeries&#151;there is an obliteration
of the postmarks upon four of them&#151;both postmark and stamps
are forgeries.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. JONES. The one shilling Victorian
has dividing lines&#151;<font color="#FF0000">the Sandwich
Islands stamps are different in size, but similar in the central
figure of the design to the 25-cent Sandwich Islands stamp</font>&#151;I
never got the rest of my money from Clayton&#151;I am the
proprietor of the <i>Stamp News</i>&#151;we advertise our right
to refuse advertisements without giving reasons; also
advertisements dealing in forgeries&#151;it is usual to warrant
stamps genuine&#151;people do not advertise that they will not
guarantee&#151;I have bought forgeries for comparison, and for
the Philatelical Protection Association, almost as long as I have
been in business, nearly eleven years&#151;I know the Mauritius
brown and blue stamps&#151;we sold some in November, 1890, as
mementoes of the Philatelic Exhibition&#151;they were issued
before they were perforated&#151;they were perforated by the
Philatelic Exhibition committee by Perkins and Co.&#151;they were
not officially perforated.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. WILLIS. I have not knowingly sold
forgeries&#151;the price of the Suez Canal stamp is two
shillings&#151;they were not more in 1889; I believe they are a
shilling dearer now than they were&#151;Kenver of Paris wrote us
for Suez Canal stamps, and I wrote Sarpy for them&#151;I did not
know they were not genuine, I had never seen the stamps&#151;I
did not send them to Paris&#151;we have 20,000 correspondents,
and I cannot recollect McCarthy&#151;the eightpenny Canal stamps
were reprints&#151;we have a price list&#151;there is a slight
difference in a paper of reprints&#151;a good many customers
would not know the difference&#151;I believe plates have been
bought from the Government&#151;as far as I recollect reprints
are gummed&#151;some Governments have reproduced stamps from old
plates&#151;those are reprints&#151;that has been going on for
ten years in British Guiana, Austria, and the United
States&#151;quantities have been disposed of&#151;the last
occasion I bought of Benjamin and Sarpy was two or three years
ago&#151;I have bought forged stamps from them&#151;Felsenthaal
has bought from Benjamin and Sarpy forged stamps, which I asked
him to get for the Protection Association; and I sent them on at
once&#151;Penny, not Felsenthaal, sold me a die&#151;Penny is a
friend of Felsenthaal, and the prisoners&#151;he lives near New
Cross&#151;we guarantee the stamps we sell, including reprints,
which we sell as reprints; they are not called genuine; I do not
ask if the stamp is genuine; I use my own judgment, as larger
dealers do.</p>

<p><i>Re-examined.</i> I was present at Cullum Street when the
police searched the premises, after the prisoners were in
custody&#151;I do not recollect any dies being found there; I saw
some things to hold type in, but I did not see everything that
was there&#151;I was present when the stamps were looked
through&#151;I have no recollection of seeing any Sandwich
Islands stamps&#151;I did not see any V. R. stamps.</p>

<p>SAMUEL GIBBONS. I am a cabdriver&#151;on 23rd December I drove
some people to Leman Street police-station&#151;I afterwards
found a large envelope containing a lot of stamps&#151;I handed
it in the same condition to Inspector Stephens at Stonesend
Police-station&#151;no one had been in the cat) after I put down
the fare at Leman Street till I found the envelope.</p>

<p>WILLIAM STEPHENS (<i>Police Inspector M</i>). On the night of
23rd and 24th December Gibbons handed me this envelope&#151;I
handed it to Sergeant White.</p>

<p>STEPHEN WHITE (<i>Police Sergeant</i>). On 23rd December I
received three warrants for the defendants' arrest&#151;about
5.30 p.m. I saw Benjamin at 1, Cullum Street&#151;I read one
warrant to him&#151;he said, &quot;I expected this for some time;
this is trade jealous; I have an answer to it&quot;&#151;he was
taken to Leman Street and searched; a large number of stamps were
found on him, and two cards (<i>produced</i>)&#151;the stamps and
pocket-book were in his pockets&#151;the same night at 10.30 I
went to 80, Grove Road, Bow&#151;I read a warrant to
Jeffreys&#151;he said, &quot;I have done printing for Benjamin
and Sarpy; I used to do it upon this table&quot;&#151;this was in
the printing-room upstairs&#151;&quot;I admit I have <i>faked</i>
up stamps for Benjamin and. Sarpy, but have not done anything for
them for a long time; I have sold my press, and have given up the
<i>faking</i> business; I have not defrauded anyone&quot;&#151;he
was taken to the station in a cab&#151;Cumner and I were in the
cab&#151;he was searched; nothing was found on him relating to
the charge&#151;afterwards I went to Stephens, who gave me this
envelope&#151;it has Jeffreys' address on it, and the name
&quot;Kirk&quot;&#151;I showed it to the prisoners, and said,
&quot;This has been found in the cab&quot;&#151;they all denied
it belonged to them&#151;Jeffreys said, &quot;I know nothing
about it&quot;&#151;next morning the prisoners were brought up
before the Magistrate at the Thames Police-court&#151;while
waiting Jeffreys said, &quot;I put the envelope and stamps under
the seat of the cab; I was foolish to do it, and I am very
sorry&quot;&#151;the same day I searched the house, 46, Oval
Road, Kennington, occupied by Benjamin and Sarpy&#151;I found a
large quantity of stamps; a few are produced&#151;on 29th
December I got a search warrant to search 80, Grove Road&#151;I
searched early on 30th December&#151;in a coal cellar under the
staircase I found two printing presses and three or four
lithographic stones&#151;this is one (<i>produced</i>)&#151;it
has the impression of stamps upon it&#151;I left the printing
presses and the other stones&#151;one was as large as this one,
one as large again, and some type cases&#151;all seemed thrown in
in a hurry&#151;I found no business books, engraving materials,
nor printing ink, nor type, only a case stand in the back
kitchen&#151;on 31st December I went with Buhl and Phillips, and
a City search warrant to 1, Cullum Street&#151;in a safe I found
this book, containing a quantity of stamps, and in the back of
the shop, behind the screen, this parcel of stamps (<i>produced</i>)&#151;I
put them into this parcel with the cheque-book and other
papers&#151;I brought away only those pointed out by Buhl and
Phillips&#151;I also found some printers' ink, and two bottles
containing acid, one muriatic acid&#151;I did not bring them
away, nor the printing presses, but I took possession of some
perforating machines&#151;there were a great many stamps besides
those taken away&#151;they were stowed in two sacks half
full&#151;I did not take them out of the sacks&#151;hundreds were
in a frame in the window, and in the safe were thousands&#151;I
did not take many out of the window&#151;I found no metal type,
but two or three wood blocks, and what looks like a stamp handle.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. JONES. I did not search Jeffreys
till I got him to the station&#151;the presses, one older than
the other, could be used for type or stone&#151;one had a kind of
bed for a frame or stone&#151;there was some coal in the cellar;
not two or three tons&#151;the stone has not been out of my
possession except last Saturday, when Sergeant Cumner had
it&#151;I heard counsel ask for a print from the stone&#151;I
heard you tell the Magistrate in the presence of Phillips that
the blue Victorias could not come from that stone&#151;there is a
twelve-stamp impression on it&#151;Jeffreys has spoken about the
application for the impression&#151;Jeffreys was refused to be
allowed to test it&#151;when arrested Jeffreys said there were
fakes in every trade.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. WILLIS. I did not examine the
bottles of acid.</p>

<p>THOMAS CUMNER. On 23rd December, about 8.45 p.m., I arrested
Sarpy in St. George's Road, Southwark&#151;I told him I was a
police officer, and had a warrant for his arrest&#151;he said,
&quot;What for?&quot;&#151;I said, &quot;Attempting to cheat and
defraud Her Majesty's subjects, and forging stamps&quot;&#151;he
said, &quot;I have been expecting this for some time; this is
only spite&quot;&#151;he was taken to the station and
searched&#151;upon him were found a large quantity of stamps and
documents&#151;they are produced, marked &quot;Sarpy, found on
person&quot;&#151;I was present at 1, Cullum Street, on 31st
December, 1891, when the search was made&#151;I saw metal blocks
and type &quot;stops&quot; to keep the type together, but no type
or dies for printing postmarks&#151;I saw this rubber stamp
handle&#151;I was also present at 46, Oval Road&#151;&quot;Sydney
View&quot; is on the house&#151;I took this stone to Mr.
Griffiths, a lithographer, 41, Wych Street&#151;I saw him examine
it&#151;I brought it away in the same condition.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. JONES. Griffiths did not take an
impression&#151;he measured it&#151;Jeffreys was not there.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. WILLIS. I saw this notice posted
on the wall of the shop at 1, Cullum Street, &quot;Special
Notice: I will not be answerable for the genuineness of any
stamps bought at this shop unless I give a written guarantee at
the time of purchase. By order.&#151;A. Benjamin, 1, Cullum
Street, E. C.&quot;&#151;this paper was hung on a gaspipe, and
partly covered the notice&#151;the pipe was not movable, I
believe&#151;when I saw it was on 31st December, three or four
days after the prisoners were in custody&#151;the paper was
broken and hanging cornerwise&#151;nothing touched it during the
search&#151;I was there the whole time&#151;there was only one
gaslight in the shop&#151;I measured the shop with tape&#151;the
counter is about 9 ft., and there is 2 ft. 6 1/2 in. from the end
of the counter; I have not the width.</p>

<p><i>Re-examined.</i> The special notice was at the end of the
counter, furthest from the door.</p>

<p>RUDOLPH MYER (<i>Re-examined</i>). I was a frequenter of this
shop for stamps for about four years&#151;I did not see this
notice; my attention was drawn to the fact there was such a
notice&#151;I went there six months ago.</p>

<p>THEODORE BUHL (<i>Re-examined</i>). I often frequented this
shop&#151;I never saw the notice except when the place was
searched.</p>

<p>DOUGLAS MACKENZIE. I frequently went to this shop&#151;I never
saw the notice.</p>

<p>EDWARD DENNY BACON. I live at Ilford&#151;I am one of the firm
of Bacon and Hastings, of 41, Seething Lane, malt factors&#151;I
am an expert in postage stamps&#151;I was secretary to the
Philatelical Society of London for some years; also honorary
treasurer&#151;I have been a collector for the past twenty years,
and have written a good many papers upon stamps&#151;I assisted
in examining the celebrated collection of T. K. Taplin, which he
left to the nation, the finest collection in this country, and
worth about £30,000&#151;I have examined the stamps
produced&#151;<font color="#FF0000">the Sandwich Islands postage
stamps are bogus</font>; no such design was ever issued&#151;it
is a stamp that has been made to defraud people&#151;it is not

the value of stamps sometimes&#151;a postal mark up on a fiscal
stamp would enhance its value, and perforating; sometimes
rouletting&#151;it would make them rare&#151;perforating was
invented about 1864&#151;<font color="#FF0000">the 1s. 9d. green

the parcel&#151;<font color="#FF0000">the 8d. brown Ceylon is a

not yet examined the postmarks&#151;the Ceylon 4d. perforated
would be worth about £8; the 8d. one would range from £8 or £9
downwards to 30s., and the 1s. 9d. and 2s. about the same&#151;as
they are they are valueless&#151;I have not examined the 18
kreutzer Baden&#151;I find an envelope with a large number of 12
kreutzer Bavarian stamps in the Oval Road portion; that was
originally on a 12 kreutzer money order card&#151;it has been
converted into an adhesive postage stamp&#151;the postmark on it
is a forgery, its value would be some few pounds, in its present
condition several shillings&#151;15s. if genuine&#151;I say the
same with regard to the other samples, they are valueless in the
condition they are&#151;the Sydney Views are very good forgeries,
and likely to deceive the postal authorities&#151;I believe they
could be used for letters in Australia&#151;they have not been
withdrawn, and could be used for postal purposes&#151;there are
about 160 Victoria blue 1s. stamps in the Oval Road parcel&#151;I
produce samples of the perforated and unperforated&#151;they are
forgeries&#151;some are used and some unused&#151;the anna stamps
are genuine, but the postmarks are forged, and the surcharges,
consisting of the words &quot;Service, Postage&quot; the 8-anna
without the surcharge is worth 1d. or 2d&#132; with it £8 or
£9; the 4-anna the same and £6, the 2-anna the same and £2 to
£3&#151;I found <font color="#FF0000">six used Sydney Views</font>
in the envelope left in the cab, 70 to 80 in Oval Road parcel,
and two in Cullum Street parcel of 2-annas, one unused in the
envelope and one in the Oval Eoad parcel; of the four annas one
in the envelope unused, two used in the Oval Road parcel; the
8-annas are unused, and seven or eight used in the Oval Eoad
parcel; the <font color="#FF0000">Victoria 1s. blue</font>, two
unperforated and two perforated, all unused in the envelope; over
100 used unperforated and 60 used perforated in the Oval Road
parcel; the <font color="#FF0000">1s. 9d. green Ceylon</font>,
three unused in the envelope, and over forty used in the Oval
parcel&#151;there were many other false stamps.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. JONES. I have been an expert ten
years&#151;I consider it fair to compare the stamps when gummed
on paper&#151;I have heard of hinged mounts for examining
stamps&#151;I examined them as I found them in the
parcel&#151;some have been gummed on paper since &#151;I do not
recollect seeing the word &quot;Specimen&quot; upon any&#151;I
have one here that haw it on the back&#151;sticking them on
paper, that would disappear; there are lots without it&#151;I was
not called before the Magistrate&#151;I was first asked about the
case last Wednesday&#151;I have seen Phillips here; I have not
spoken to him, I believe&#151;I. do not see him here
now&#151;when I have reprints I have bought them as
reprints&#151;Stanley Gibbons' catalogue first introduced them to
my notice&#151;Berchdoff stamps can be bought which are not
reprints or <i>fac similes.</i> </p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. WILLIS. I have never been a
witness to speak to the genuineness of stamps before&#151;I was
asked to examine these by Phillip&#151;he is managing director of
Stanley Gibbons and Co., Limited, a house dealing largely in
stamps of all kinds&#151;he did not tell me he had been told he
ought not to come as a witness; nothing of the kind he asked me
to give evidence, as Major Evans was unwell&#151;I was asked to
go to the Police-court, but said it was inconvenient&#151;I have
been familiar with forged stamps ever since I began to collect,
over twenty years&#151;I have never seen so many collected
before&#151;I have seen a large number of various kinds, and
different countries&#151;I have bought them for my own
collection&#151;I have had forged stamps without knowing
it&#151;nothing like 500&#151;perhaps 50 to 100&#151;forgeries
have been in a collection I have bought, but I did not buy for
the forgeries&#151;I have known others buy forgeries who have
been deceived.</p>

<p><i>Re-examined.</i> The value of the unused Sydney Views to
collectors would be £10&#151;they are very rare&#151;the stamp
is not withdrawn, but has ceased to be issued&#151;there has been
an improvement in the art of forging stamps during the last
twenty years&#151;during the last two or three years they have
been at their best&#151;there are <i>fac simile</i> stamps, they
have the word <i>&quot;fac simile</i>&quot; on&#151;Major Evans
is a member of the Philatelical Society of London&#151;I believe
the Sydney View could be used to-day in New South Wales and
Victoria for postal purposes.</p>

<p>DOUGLAS GARTH. I am President of the Philatelical Society, and
am a solicitor&#151;I have had considerable experience in
stamps&#151;there is no genuine trade done in forgeries&#151;I
have seen some of these stamps, and have heard Mr. Bacon's
evidence&#151;I perfectly agree with the results he has arrived
at.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. JONES. I have collected for
fourteen years&#151;I know of Mr. Palmer&#151;I have had nothing
to do with him for the last ten years&#151;I saw a great many
stamps which he had then, but I never saw his collection&#151;I
know the laureated New South Wales halfpenny stamp&#151;there are
a great many genuine ones in this country&#151;there are stamps
sent over by Mr. Venning&#151;I have not seen any of them in Mr.
Phillips' hands&#151;I read the <i>Stamp News</i> and Stanley
Gibbons' <i>Monthly Journal</i> occasionally&#151;the stamps sent
over by Mr. Venning are not officially issued&#151;those from Mr.
Clark which were stolen <i>were</i> obtained by fraud&#151;I have
not purchased any of Stanley Gibbons and Co.&#151;I never knew
that they sent them to Australia with a view to their being used
there postally&#151;I know Peffenden and Wilson as dealers; they
used to issue a monthly list; there is a paper which they called <i>The
Record</i>, edited by Major Evans&#151;for all I know, stamps
were advertised which were reprints, without disclosing the fact
that they were reprints.</p>

<p>JOHN CHARLES GRIFFITHS. I am a lithographer, of New Inn,
Strand&#151;I have examined this lithographic stone, and some of
the blue 1s. Victorian stamps; they appear to be impressions from
the stone; the back ground lines are identical, and there are
other technicalities of the trade which enable me to speak
confidently&#151;I compared two very small points in the stamps
with the stone, and found identical marks&#151;my opinion was
taken, and I advised that further impressions should be taken
from the stone.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. JONES. I saw it on Monday at my
office, and examined it with a magnifying-glass&#151;the flaw is
a very small matter; you will find a very small indent in the
background just at the top of the forehead, on the second stamp
on the left on the stone, the second row, on the forehead&#151;I
also And the lines on the background correspond in number&#151;I
do not detect any register marks, the stone is too dirty, it
would require to be cleaned&#151;the stamps on the stone are not
very much closer than those on the paper, they register exactly,
that was one of the tests I applied&#151;the bottom row on the
stone and the bottom row of the stamps correspond exactly&#151;if
the stone had been cut in half they could have tried to pull a
proof of one half, leaving the other half intact&#151;I was not
asked to do that.</p>

<p>STEPHEN WHITE (<i>Re-examined</i>). I found a number of
letters at Sydney View Villa, which I have produced&#151;I found
both these letters on Benjamin: &quot;Henry Grimold,
Esq.,&#151;Enclosed are <font color="#FF0000">the four Bermuda
3d. and 1d. that I bought of you some time since, and which are
pronounced by Major Evans and others to be a false surcharge</font>.
Please return me the £101 paid for them, and oblige&#151;Yours
truly.&#151;&quot;Henry Grimold, Esq., Dear Sir,&#151;I received
your postal-card, but I decline to exchange any more with you, as
I would not deal with any man who is not honest. I enclose a
letter received to-day, and also eighteen of your guaranteed
surcharges. The British Guiana, I believe, are also bad. Now I
owed you about thirteen dollars, and will square that amount, and
as soon as I can get the balance of the Bermudas I will also
return them. I have had more trouble about these counterfeits
than anything, &amp;c.&#151;Yours truly, Reynolds. &quot;This (<i>produced</i>)
is one of the documents I found at Cullum Street. (<i>This named
a number of stamps in the writer's possession.</i>)</p>

<p>MR. JONES <i>submitted that the Counts relating to forgery
were bad, at they disclosed no offence, a postage stamp not being
a writing as alleged; that the foreign stamps were not more than
labels. As to the Sandwich Islands stamp, it was proved that no
such stamp ever existed, and therefore it could not be
counterfeited, and that it was no more forgery to copy such a
stamp than it would be to copy a patent medicine stamp or the
label on a reel of cotton.</i> </p>

<p>MR. WILLIS <i>also submitted that the offence was not one at
common law;</i> (<i>he question was whether any of the stamps
produced was a document or instrument in writing. Some of these
stamps had been actually used, so that there was no intention of
injuring the person who originally used them. The Sydney View
stamp being no longer in use, did not constitute a contract
between that country and the Postmaster-General, and therefore
the first twenty-three Counts could not be sustained.</i> (<i>Cases
referred to, Reg.</i> v. <i>Gloss</i>, 7 <i>Cox, p.</i> 494; <i>Reg.</i>
v. <i>John Smith</i>, 8 C <i>ox, p.</i> 586; <i>and Reg.</i> v. <i>Gordon</i>
11 <i>Cox</i>, p. 672.)</p>

<p>MR. MATHEWS <i>contended that the Counts were good;
Blackstone's definition of forgery teas &quot;the altering of a
writing to the prejudice of another man's right&quot;</i> (<i>East's,
&quot;the counterfeiting any writing with a fraudulent intent</i>,<i>
whereby another may be prejudiced&quot;; also, &quot;the false
making of any written instrument for the purpose of fraud and
deceit, is a forgery&quot; In this case the writing consisted of
the sketches from which the Sandwich Island plates were engraved,
and of the letters and effigies on the counterfeit stamps.</i> (<i>Cases
referred to, Reg.</i> v. <i>Fossett, East's Pleas of the Crown</i>,
862; <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Harris, Moody's Crown Cases</i>, 393; <i>Reg.</i>
v. <i>Tosackf and Dennison</i> 179; <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Sharman,
Dearsley's Crown Cases</i>, 285; <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Howley</i>) <i>Lee
and Cave</i>, 159. <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Dugdale, and Stevens' Digest</i>
302.</p>

<p>MR. WILLIS <i>was heard in reply.</i> </p>

<p><i>The</i> RECORDER <i>considered that the Counts</i> 1 to 23 <i>and
Count</i> 26 <i>had failed in proof, as the stamps in question
were not instruments in writing, and left the other five Counts
to the</i> JURY, <i>as follows:</i> 1. <i>Was there an agreement
to bring stamps into existence for the purpose of defrauding the
public?</i> 2. <i>Was there an agreement to alter stamps?</i> 3. <i>Did
the prisoners procure the stamps for the like purpose?</i> 4. <i>Did
Benjamin and Sarpy obtain money from Bright by false pretences?
The</i> JURY <i>answered these questions in the affirmative, and
a verdict of</i> </p>

<p>GUILTY <i>was entered on these five Counts.</i> </p>

<p><i>The prisoners received a good character.</i> </p>

<p>JEFFREYS <i>and</i> BENJAMIN&#151;<i> Six Months' Hard Labour
each; </i></p>

<p>SARPY&#151;<i> Four Months' Hard Labour. </i></p>

<p><i>The prisoners were again indicted for forging and uttering
a receipt for one shilling blue Victorian stamp, upon which no
evidence was offered. </i></p>
