Works by V.E.Tyler, Charles Lyford first started forging stamps
in 1866. </p>

Taylor 'Prince Edwards' bogus issue</p>

<p align="left">A bogus issue with a ship and inscription 'PRINCE
EDWARDS ISLAND' ('EDWARDS' with 'S'), was issued by the stamp
forger <a href="taylor2.htm">Allan Taylor</a>. The book 'The
mystery of the Prince Edward Queen' by William J.Eckhardt
mentions that in December 1866 a bogus stamp was issued also with
wrong inscription 'Prince Edwards Island', in black on yellow
paper, imperforate. This forgery was made by Charley (Charles)
Lyford, an accomplice of Allan Taylor. Probably, these are the
same forgeries. Apparently, this stamp inspired Taylor to make
much more convincing forgeries of Prince Edward Island. An image
of this bogus stamp appears in The Philatelist, Jan 1, 1867, page
25. </p>
