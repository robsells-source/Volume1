Portrait of Hausburg as found in The Philatelic Record 1904, page
26-28, under 'Notable Philatelists'.</p>

<p>I've often seen imperforate blocks of the first New Zealand
stamps in the colour black. They are sometimes referred to as
Hausburg (sometimes wrongly written as 'Hausberg') reprints and
sometimes they are called 'proofs'. They seem to have been made
in 1906. Leslie Leopold Rudolph Hausburg (1872-1917; famous for
his book 'The postage stamps and telegraph stamps of British
India of 1907) went to New Zealand and discovered the original
plates of these stamps. From these plates reprints were made for
him. See also
http://www.nzstamps.org.uk/chalon/reprint/index.html. Examples of
such reprints:</p>

2 p black Hausburg reprint and a block of four 1 Sh Hausburg
reprints</p>

<p align="left">I've also seen the 4 p and 6 p of these Hausburg
reprints, the 1 p and 3 p should also exist (all in black). I've
even seen a whole sheet of 240 stamps of the 2 p black.</p>

<p align="left">These reprints are relatively common (230,000
were printed according to the above mentioned source). </p>
