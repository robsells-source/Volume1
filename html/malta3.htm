<hr>

<p>From 1st of March 1858 onwards, stamps became obligatory on a
outgoing mail from Malta. Stamps from Great Britain were used for
this purpose. This practise was continued until the stamps of
1885 were issued (the 1/2 p previously issued was only intended
to serve for inland mail).</p>

<h3>Stamps of <a href="great.htm">Great Britain</a>, used in
Malta:</h3>

<p>I would like to thank Emmanuel Cesare for putting the
following information at my disposal.</p>

<h4>1) Double ring, 'MALTA' on top (rings broken up to make space
for this word), diameter 27 mm, used before 1857</h4>

<pre>This cancel is known to be used on 
a) the 1841 imperforate 'penny brown' 
b) and the 6 p violet embossed stamp. </pre>

<p>Sorry, no picture available, if anybody posesses a picture,
please contact me!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>2) Wavy line cancel (military mail) used from 1855 to 1858</h4>

<h4 align="left">3) The cancel 'M' was used in Malta from 1857 to
1860 </h4>

<img src="brcol2/gbm.jpg" width="175" height="204"><br>
'M' cancel</p>

<p align="left">There seem to be three different 'M' cancels,
slightly varying in size; The first type of the &#145;M'
canceller consists of the letter 'M' which (6.5 mm wide and 9.7mm
high), surrounded by twelve horizontal lines, all broken except
the two above and the two below the 'M'. In the second type the
'M' measures 7.0 mm by 9.2 mm. Finally, the third type measures
7.5 mm by 9.2 mm. In 1860 this 'M' cancel was no longer used
(some exceptions exist however).</p>
<div align="left">

<pre>This cancel was used on the following stamps of Great Britain: 
a) 1 p perforated and imperforate penny brown 
b) 2 p perforated and imperforate penny blue 
c) 4 p red (1855 type)
d) 6 p violet embossed stamp
e) 6 p violet (1855 type)
d) 1 Sh green (1855 type)</pre>
</div>

<h4 align="left">4) Cancel 'A25' used from 1859 to 1884 </h4>

<p align="left">The 'A25' exists as a single cancel but also as a
'duplex' cancel; next to the 'A25' which is intended to cancel
the stamp, a circular part with inscription 'MALTA' and the date
is included in this cancel (see the image of the 6 p stamp
below). I've seen them with a straight '5' in 'A25' and with a
slanting '5'. </p>

('A25' Malta cancels)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="brcol2/maltenv1.jpg"><br>
(Letter with 'A25' duplex cancel)</p>

<p align="left">Most stamps of Great Britain of the period 1859
to 1884 can be found with this cancel. </p>

<p align="left">The 'A25' cancel also exists in a 'vertical oval'
size (introduced in 1880). It exists as a duplex cancel, but also
as a single cancel. Here a picture of this cancel on a postcard
of Malta:</p>

<h1 align="center">Stamps of other countries cancelled in Malta</h1>

<p align="left">I have seen Malta cancels on French stamps,
(probably from letters mailed at sea), examples:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="brcol2/maltfr1.jpg"><img
src="brcol2/maltfr1.jpg" border="0" width="199" height="228"></a>
<img src="brcol2/maltfr2.jpg" width="187" height="224"></p>

<p align="left">According to Emmanuel Cesare stamps of Italy,
Tunesia and the Netherlands can also be found with 'A25 ' cancels
(though I have never seen them myself). I've also seen a postcard
of Italy (10 c around 1909) with a Malta cancel (single circle).</p>
