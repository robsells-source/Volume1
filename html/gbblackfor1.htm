<h4>Forgeries etc:</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="great2/photographicfor.jpg"><img

I've been told that this is a photographic forgery</p>

border="0" width="189" height="211"></a><br>
Forgeries of the &quot;VR&quot; stamp, they have no dot behind
&quot;PENNY&quot;. I've seen it with the bottom corner letters
&quot;EW&quot;, &quot;IP&quot;, &quot;JD&quot;, &quot;OA&quot;,
&quot;MO&quot;, &quot;NW&quot;, &quot;LS&quot; and
&quot;LT&quot;. The face is quite 'white'. A similar forgery of
the ordinary stamp is shown as well (with corner letters JD).</p>

<p align="center"><a href="great2/forg25.jpg"><img
src="great2/forg25.jpg" border="0" width="185" height="225"></a><br>
Forgery with &quot;T P&quot; corner letters. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="great2/forg26.jpg"><img
src="great2/forg26.jpg" border="0" width="331" height="243"></a><br>
Forgery with letters on top as well </p>

<a href="great2/gbfacs4b.jpg"><img src="great2/gbfacs4b.jpg"
border="0" width="185" height="211"></a><br>
Another Facsimile made from a photograph, 'FACSIMILE' written on
the back of the stamp</p>

<p align="center"><a href="great2/tobler4.jpg"><img
src="great2/tobler4.jpg" border="0" width="232" height="259"></a><br>
A forgery with a red &quot;Facsimile&quot; printed on it, it is
cut from a Tobler Chocolate label (see next scan)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/toblerforg1f.jpg" width="800"
height="424"><br>
Tobler Chocolate labels. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="great2/forg17.jpg"><img

href="great2/forg17e.jpg"><img src="great2/forg17e.jpg"
border="0" width="817" height="587"></a><br>
Other forgery with very large 'I G' in the corners, no dots in
the background and the side ornaments too perfectly done. I've
seen it with cancel. This forgery appears to have been cut from a
commemorative sheet for the &quot;ESPOSIZIONE MONDIALE DI
FILATELIA&quot; in Rome of 1985. It also contained an image of
the first 5 c stamp of Sardinia. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/forg11.jpg" width="481"
height="276"><br>
Forged envelope with orange &quot;ORMSKIRK AP23 1843&quot; cancel
and blue Maltese cross cancels containing two penny-blacks</p>

<p>There exists at least three stamps with similar design with
inscription 'LUNDY'; 'ONE PUFFIN' in black or brown and 'TWO
PUFFINS' in blue, they were issued for the island of <a
href="lundy.htm">Lundy</a> (bogus issues). The letters 'J' and
'A' are in the left and right lower corners respectively.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="great/lundy.jpg" width="625"
height="442"><br>
(Lundy bogus stamps)</p>

<p>I have seen a forgery of the 2 p blue stamp, made from the
next issue (with white lines) by colouring the white lines blue,
see pictures above.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="great2/vrfor1.jpg"><img
src="great2/vrfor1.jpg" border="0" width="183" height="210"></a><br>
('VR' forgery, made from a genuine stamp by adding the letters
'V' and 'R'?)</p>

<p align="left">It appears that it is possible to chemically
alter the red color of the next 1 p issue to black. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/london1.jpg" width="700"

(London Exhibition Sheet, 'reproduced by the collotype process
printed by Waterlow &amp; Sons Limited')</p>

<p>In 1950 a souvenir sheet was issued in London for 'The London
International Stamp Exhibtion'. On this souvenir sheet there is a
1 Sh Nova Scotia 1852 violet stamp, a Penny Black (corner letters
GB) , a New South Wales 1 p red 1850, a Ceylon 4 p 1859 and a 4 p
Cape triangle of 1853, it was reproduced by the collotype process
and printed by Waterlow &amp; Sons Limited. I have seen all the
cuts from this sheet offered as forgeries. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="great2/gbfacs2000.jpg"><img
src="great2/gbfacs2000.jpg" border="0" width="202" height="230"></a><br>
Cut from this 1950 souvenir sheet. Part of the &quot;1840&quot;
can still be seen.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/gbfacs3.jpg" width="519"
height="433"><br>
Facsimiles of the Castle Museum York, I've also seen one with a
red Maltese cross cancel on a piece of paper. Note the white dot
below the 'O' of 'POSTAGE'. I've also seen the words &quot;CASTLE
MUSEUM YORK&quot; being blackened out, the resulting stamp
pretending to be a 'reprint'.</p>

<a href="great2/gbfor5105.jpg"><img src="great2/gbfor5105.jpg"
border="0" width="520" height="396"></a><br>
Some more blocks of 6 modern forgeries. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="great2/gbfacs10.jpg"><img
src="great2/gbfacs10.jpg" border="0" width="256" height="273"></a><br>
I presume this is cut from one of the above sheetlets.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="great2/philympia3.jpg"><img
src="great2/philympia3.jpg" alt="Philympia stamps of 1970"
border="0" width="1278" height="736"></a><br>
Philympia set of stamps of 1970 on cover.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="great2/gbPhilympia1970_2.jpg"><img
src="great2/gbPhilympia1970_2.jpg" border="0" width="370"
height="207"></a><br>
Cuts from 1970 Philympia stamps. Any uncancelled 1 p black stamps
with 'PL' corner letters (or with 'modern' cancels) most likely
come from these commemorative stamps. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="great2/gbreproduction4.jpg"><img
src="great2/gbreproduction4.jpg" border="0" width="277"
height="298"></a> <img src="great2/gb201b.jpg" width="800"

With corner letters 'SW' (impossible?). A reproduction cut from
the the minisheet of 1990 shown next to it?</p>

<h4>Reprint 1</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="great2/royalrepr1.jpg"><img
src="great2/royalrepr1.jpg" border="0" width="178" height="208"></a>
<a href="great2/royalrepr1b.jpg"><img
src="great2/royalrepr1b.jpg" border="0" width="174" height="209"></a><br>
Royal reprint, with an inverted watermark</p>

<p>In 1864 a so-called 'Royal reprint' was made on paper with
watermark 'Large Crown' (always inverted?). This was done by
making prints of the plate nr 66 of the 1 p red. They were
apparently ordered by members of the Royal family, but
considerable confusion exists about this subject. It is not known
how many reprints were actually made. More information can be
found at:
http://www.members.tripod.com/~pennyreds/royalreprint.html. </p>

<h4>Reprint 2</h4>

<p>I've seen reprints of the 1 p black (General &amp; VR issues)
in unissued colours (green, orange, violet, red and brown). They
are also known as 'Rainbow-reprints', due to the these many
colours. Apparently these reprints were authorised by the Lord
Mayor of London to raise funds for the British Red Cross during
World War II. They were sold at Lancaster House London between
6th &amp; 11th May 1940 (printed by Waterlow &amp; Sons Ltd). All
the reprints I have seen have the letter 'D' in the lower left
corner and 'K' in the lower right corner:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/repr1.jpg" width="533"
height="205"> <a href="great2/gbrepr203.jpg"><img
src="great2/gbrepr203.jpg" border="0" width="170" height="197"></a>
<a href="great2/gbrepr202.jpg"><img src="great2/gbrepr202.jpg"
border="0" width="165" height="195"></a><br>
(Reprints in fancy colours of the &quot;VR&quot; issue and the
normal stamp)</p>

<p align="left">By the way, I suspect that the above items are
actually cut from a much larger 'reprint' stamp as shown below:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/repr2.jpg" width="353"
height="256"> <img src="great2/gbrepr208.jpg" width="653"
height="233"><br>
Perforated 'reprint' with attached label at the left, inscription
&quot;STAMP CENTENARY EXHIBITION LONDON 6th - 11th MAY,
1940.&quot; These were included in a larger sheetlet with other
labels. On top of the sheetlet is written &quot;Sold in aid of
the Lord Mayor's Red Cross and St.John Fund Stamp Centenary
Exhibition, Lancaster House, 6th-11th May 1940&quot; and at the
bottom twice &quot;Souvenir Rotaglio Print by Waterlow &amp; Sons
Ltd. London&quot;.</p>
