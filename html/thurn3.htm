<h1 align="center">Forgeries</h1>

<p align="left">The Serrane guide mentions some crude forgeries
from Nuremberg etc, besides the more advanced forgeries described
next. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat2/thurfor1.jpg" width="608"
height="383"><br>
(Fournier forgeries, except probably the 3 k which might be
genuine)</p>

<p align="left">The forger <a href="fournier1.htm">Fournier</a>
seems to have made forgeries of these stamps (kreuzer and
silbgr), I think only black on coloured paper. Another forger (<a
href="oneglia1.htm">Oneglia</a>?, <a href="venturinigb.htm">Venturini</a>?)
printed the forgeries for him in Turin (Italy) on white paper
(source Serrane Guide). Fournier then dyed the paper in the
required color himself. Fournier offered both mint and used
forgeries. In 'The Fournier Album of Philatelic Forgeries' the
following numeral cancels can be found &quot;8&quot; (or actually
more an inverted &quot;6&quot;?), &quot;95&quot;,
&quot;195&quot;, &quot;142&quot; and &quot;34&quot;. I've only
seen these forgeries in Fournier Albums. They seem to be not
common at all. The next image shows a page of a Fournier Album
with Thurn and Taxis forgeries: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat3/thurfour1.jpg" width="1275"

Album page with Fournier forgeries and forged cancels taken from
'The Fournier Album of Philatelic Forgeries', they were printed
with a large black margin all around (which was of course cut off
later). The &quot;95&quot; forged cancel (always?) seems to have
a part of the outer circle missing.</p>

<h4 align="left">For distinguishing characteristics of the
Fournier forgeries are (all of them are quite deceptive, also
note non-consistent background colors or too large margins on
some stamps), <a href="thurn4.htm">click here</a>.</h4>

<p align="left">As far as I know, Fournier only forged the black
stamps on coloured paper. </p>

Three forgeries of the 1/4 sgr stamp, one in red one in black on
orange and one in orange color. The &quot;/&quot; of the large
&quot;1/4&quot; does not seem curved enough at the top. I've also
seen a very similar forgery (also 1/4 silb. gr. in red) with the
printed separating lines all around it (but not separated at
these lines). Note that the lower right horn is inverted (mouth
pointing towards the bottom, see image below), it is listed as
forgery 'd' in the Serrane guide. This forgery is quite common,
but it is not identical to the above Fournier forgeries. This
forgery is mentioned in Album Weeds (as first and second forgery;
the second forgery being a bad printing of the first one). The
dot on the 'i' of 'Freimarke' is place exactly on top of the 'i'
and not slightly to the left of it as in the genuine stamps. The
fourth and fifth forgery have a &quot;<a href="correosfor.htm">CORREOS
7.1.60. II-III</a>&quot; cancel. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat3/thurinvhorn.jpg" width="135"

The inverted horn in the lower right part of the 1/4 sgr forgery.
</p>

<p align="left">Another forgery of the 1/4 Sgr red is mentioned
in Album Weeds, with red dashes surrounding the design (as in the
1866 issue). Genuine 1/4 Sgr red stamps do not have these dashes.
Sorry, no image available yet. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurn1_4asis.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurn1_4asis.jpg" border="0" width="217" height="218"></a><br>
Another forgery of the 1/4 value. </p>

<p align="left">Forged 1/4 Sgr black on brown stamps are known to
exist made from 1/4 Sgr black stamps by dying the paper (see
Album Weeds). The Serrane guide lists four different 'good'
forgeries of the 1/4 Sgr value. </p>

<p>Forgeries of the 10 Silbgr:</p>

Forgery; I've seen it with a &quot;42&quot;, &quot;51&quot; or
&quot;69&quot; cancel. These forgeries were also offered by
Fournier (but most likely not produced by him).</p>

<p align="left">The left foot of the large '1' in the above
forgeries has a different curl than the genuine stamps (the curl
is more pronounced). I've seen this forgery printed together with
the 30 kr forgery shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurfor4d.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurfor4d.jpg" border="0" width="208" height="199"></a>

href="gstat3/thurnfor4002.jpg"><img src="gstat3/thurnfor4002.jpg"
border="0" width="197" height="207"></a></p>

<p align="left">The above forgery of the 30 k has the
&quot;30&quot; in the corners much smaller than in the genuine
stamps. I have seen this forgery with the numeral cancels
&quot;35&quot;, &quot;46&quot;, &quot;59&quot;, &quot;76&quot; or
&quot;82&quot;. It also has no dot behind &quot;Kreuzer.&quot;
and the &quot;30&quot; of &quot;30 Kreuzer&quot; is placed too
high. This forgery is also mentioned in the book Album Weeds.
I've seen this forgery printed together with the 10 g forgery
shown above (two rows of stamps, three 30 kr stamps on top and
three 10 sgr stamps below). These forgeries were also offered by
Fournier (but most likely not produced by him).</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnasis4002.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnasis4002.jpg" border="0" width="208"
height="193"></a><br>
More deceptive 30 k forgery. Lettering is slightly different and
the ribbon to the right of &quot;ke&quot; is touching the upper
frameline (it doesn't do that in the genuine stamps). </p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnasis8.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnasis8.jpg" border="0" width="202" height="208"></a><br>
This 1/2 g looks real at first sight, but there are many
differences with a genuine stamp in the design and lettering. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat3/thurnfor2.jpg" width="185"
height="188"><br>
Badly printed forgery of the 1 k green value.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat/thuforcan3.jpg" width="204"

src="gstat3/thurforcan1.jpg" border="0" width="203" height="195"></a><br>
Forged cancels. The Serrane Guide also mentions forged cancels
from Blomberg, Bremen T&amp;T, Frankenberg, Hamburg T&amp;T,
Ilmenau and Marburg. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnforgedcan4003.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnforgedcan4003.jpg" border="0" width="205"
height="204"></a><br>
The cancel &quot;* TREYSA * 10 6 1860&quot; is forged according
to https://www.stampsx.com/ratgeber/stempel-bilder.php?id=735949
This cancel was only used on letters without stamps, furthermore
the town of Treysa used Groschen stamps, not Kreuzer ones......</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurfor5.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurfor5.jpg" border="0" width="209" height="207"></a><br>
Perforated 10 Sgr were not officially issued (a similar remark
can be made for the 5 Sgr, 15 Kr and 30 Kr stamps). My 1938 Senf
catalogue refers to them as 'wertlose unbefugte Erzeugnisse'
(worthless unofficial products....). I presume the cancel on this
stamp is probably forged as well.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat3/thurnfor3003.jpg" width="223"
height="227"><br>
Not sure what is this 3 kr black on yellow with no numbers in the
corners.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnfor3001.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnfor3001.jpg" border="0" width="223" height="212"></a><br>
A 9 k black on yellow forgery, the background is different from a
genuine stamp</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnfor3002.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnfor3002.jpg" border="0" width="222" height="203"></a><br>
1/2 sgr black on green, primitive forgery.</p>

<p align="left">As already mentioned many forged cancels exist on
remainders.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnphantasy1.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnphantasy1.jpg" border="0" width="242"
height="246"></a><br>
A phantasy stamp of the 1 Sgr red stamp issued in 1923 with a
Regensburg cancel. I've also seen it without cancel. I've also
seen it on a postcard together with a regular stamp, the postcard
commemorates the wedding(?) of Princess Elizabeth Helene von
Thurn und Taxis with Prince Friedrich Christian in 1923 (this
card was also cancelled 'REGENSBURG 16 JUN. 23'). If my
information is correct, 500 of these phantasy stamps were
printed. </p>

<p align="left">In 1971 a postcard with a view of Kassel and
inscription 'Kassler Salon 71 Heimat und Philatelie' was issued
with the image of a 1/4 Sgr black and a 1 Sgr red stamp. Sorry,
no image available yet. </p>

<p align="left">The stamp forger <a href="sperati.htm">Sperati</a>
made a forgery of the 1/3 Sgr stamp. He also produced 'proofs' of
this stamp. See also https://www.sperati.org/TandT/TandT.htm</p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat3/thurnSperati4001.jpg"
width="780" height="353"><br>
With a certificate from Maria Brett stating this is a Sperati
forgery (image obtained from a Cherrystone auction). It doesn't
resemble the below shown forgeries from a David Feldman auction
though? </p>

Sperati printing plate and some proofs, obtained from a David
Feldman auction. The background is not nicely done, for example
it shows a whiter area just above the &quot;/&quot; sign. </p>
