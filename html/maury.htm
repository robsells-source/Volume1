<p>According to 'Philatelic Forgers, their Lives and Works' by
V.E.Tyler, Arthur Maury was born in 1844. He published the Maury
stamp catalogue in 1865. He also published the journal 'Le
Collectioneur de timbe-poste' from 1864 onwards. However, he is
also known to have issued bogus 'D.S.' overprints on stamps of
France, pretending to be issues of Diego Suarez. I have never
seen this bogus issue myself. According to the same book, he was
also involved in bogus postage due stamps of Persia and selling
Ethiopian stamps (unauthorized postage due stamps and he sold the
Ethiopian stamp below face value:
http://www.doig.net/Maury.html). He also offered reprints and
imitations of the local stamps of the United States (in the
second edition of his Maury catalog in 1865). <br>
In 2007 the catalogues Ceres, Dallay and Maury joint forces to
become 'Group Arthur Maury' (source: http://arthurmaury.com/). </p>

<p>A picture of Arthur Maury can also be found in 'The Philatelic
Record Vol. XXIX 1907, page 230'.</p>

Maury dealer labels, with the portrait of Arthur Maury,
inscription &quot;SERBMIT SIRAPAYRUAM&quot;; when read backwards
it says &quot;TIMBRES MAURY A PARIS&quot;. This label was
apparently issued in 1894 (source:
https://www.franceandcolonies.org/philatelist/120.pdf) </p>

Dealer label of Arthur Maury in Paris, 'Collections of stamps
guaranteed genuine' the text reads in French. </p>

<p align="left">Arthur Maury also perforated some stamps with
&quot;AM&quot; (his initials) which he used in correspondence
with his customers.</p>

<p align="left">These forgeries from Diego Suarez appear to have
been inspired by images in the Maury catalogue (or perhaps even
made by Maury?): </p>

Set of primitive forgeries, made by or inspired by Maury. Note
the badly done lettering and the dented upper left and lower
right corner of the 25 c value. I've seen these forgeries printed
in blocks of four (one of each value), the 1 c and 5 c on top and
the 15 c and 25 c printed below. </p>

Some scans from the Maury catalogue (images obtained thanks to

A forgery of the 5 c value in the wrong colors: black on violet.</p>

It looks like the above forgery was based on an illustration in a
Maury catalogue (or perhaps even made by Maury? images obtained
thanks to Gerhard Lang, January 2018)</p>

It looks like the above forgery from the first issue of Reunion
was based on an illustration in a Maury catalogue (or perhaps
even made by Maury? images of the Maury catalogue obtained thanks
to Gerhard Lang, January 2018). </p>
