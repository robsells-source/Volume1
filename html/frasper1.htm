<p align="left">Sperati used a few genuine cheap stamps, bleached
out the design (with the cancel remaining intact) and reprinting
it. However, the majority of the forgeries of France made by
Sperati are total forgeries, thus the cancel was also forged. The
paper used by him is very close to the paper of the genuine
stamps. I know that Sperati made forgeries of the 10 c, 15 c, 40
c and 1 F values of the 1849 issue (several 'reproductions'). He
also made forgeries of the 2 c, 4 c, 20 c, 30 c and 80 c 1870
Bordeaux issue. More images of Sperati forgeries (including
tete-beche forgeries) can be found at:
http://www.seymourfamily.com/rfrajola/Sperati/speratiindex.htm
(Richard Frajola). Most of the images shown here have 'SPERATI
REPRODUCTION' in violet printed on the backside together with a
number (of course, Sperati did not sell his forgeries like this,
these marks were applied by the British Philatelic Association).

Sperati Part IV, 1954 British Philatelic Association. </p>

<h3 align="left">10 c 1849 issue</h3>

<p align="left">Sperati made Reproduction 'A' to 'F' of this
stamp. </p>

Reproduction 'A' of the 10 c value</p>

<p align="left">The cancel(s) on this Reproduction 'A' are always
placed in the same position. Sometimes an additional cancel was
added (see second image). </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/fransperatitypeB2.jpg"><img

height="215"></a><br>
Sperati Reproduction 'B'</p>

<p align="left">Sperati's Reproduction 'B' is very deceptive.
There is a small white dot at the lower part of the 'ES' of
'POSTES'. I don't find the other distinguishing characteristics
of the British Philatelic Association on this particular forgery
(nevertheless they are both marked 'SPERATI PRODUCTION B' on the
backside. The second forgery shown above does not even have the
small white dot between the 'ES' of 'POSTES'. The cancels that
were encountered on these forgeries are the following numeral
cancels: '318', '1675', '1792', '1954', '2221' and '3383'. Both
forgeries above bear the cancel '1792'. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/fransperatitypeC1.jpg"><img
src="franc2/fransperatitypeC1.jpg" border="0" width="194"
height="219"></a><br>
Reproduction 'C' of the 10 c value</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'C' has a very small flaw below the
'0' of the right '10 C', furthermore another flaw just above the
'C' of this same word. Again, this forgery is extremely
deceptive. The cancels used by Sperati on these forgeries are:
grill cancel (several types), mute Paris star cancel (two types),
continuous grill cancel and the following numeral cancels:
'1128', '1639' and '2221'. The above shown forgery has numeral
cancel '1639'. I've seen an uncancelled brown 'die-proof'. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/fransperatitypeD1.jpg"><img
src="franc2/fransperatitypeD1.jpg" border="0" width="184"
height="220"></a> <a href="franc2/fransperatitypeD3.jpg"><img
src="franc2/fransperatitypeD3.jpg" border="0" width="190"
height="219"></a><br>
Two Reproductions 'D' of the 10 c, both cancelled with a mute
Paris Star cancel. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/typD1.jpg" width="51"
height="49"><br>
Broken pearl of Reproduction 'D'.</p>

<p align="left">Sperati's Reproduction 'D' of the 10 c value has
a broken pearl above the middle of the left '0 C' of '10 C'. A
small break can be found in the frameline just above the 'C' of
the right '10 C'. Sperati used a grill cancel, a mute Paris Star
cancel (as shown above) or a Paris Star cancel with numeral '8'
or the numeral dot cancels '2063', '2273' (and possible others).</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'E' has a constant numeral dot
cancel '1954' (sorry, no image available yet). The numbers '1954'
are placed on the lower part of the face.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/fransperatitypeF1.jpg"><img
src="franc2/fransperatitypeF1.jpg" border="0" width="348"
height="215"></a><br>
Reproduction 'F' constisting of a Reproduction 'C' (left) and a
Reproduction 'D' (right).</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'F' is actually a pair of tete-beche
stamps constiting of a Reproduction 'C' and a reproduction 'D'.
Additionally, there is a brown dot in the 'P' of 'POSTES' on the
left hand side stamp. Another dot can be found in the 'E' of this
word. I've also seen a black 'die-proof' of this particular
Reproduction 'F'. The cancels applied on this forgery were: a
grill cancel (struck twice), a mute Paris Star cancel (struck
twice), a Paris Star numeral cancel '8', several numeral dot
cancels '698', '1425' (possibly a genuine stamp with bleached out
design), '1639', '1734', '2221', '2738' and a 'TB'(?) cancel. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/frsperati1.jpg" width="190"
height="225"><br>
Possibly a Sperati forgery (reduced size), it has the 'PLOERMEL
10 AVRIL 51 (..)' cancel as was also used by Sperati. </p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">15 c 1849 issue</h3>

<p align="left">Again Sperati made Reproduction 'A' to 'F' of
this stamp.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/fransperatitypeA5.jpg"><img
src="franc2/fransperatitypeA5.jpg" border="0" width="179"

src="franc2/speratitypeA1.jpg" border="0" width="177"
height="214"></a><br>
Reproduction 'A' of the 15 c value</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'A' is very deceptive. There is a
dent in the upper right part of the 'P' of 'POSTES'. This letter
also has its lower left side shaved off. The 'C' of 'FRANC' has a
white dot above it almost connecting it with the white space
above it. I've also seen a black 'die-proof' of Reproduction 'A'.
The following cancels were applied by Sperati: grill cancels
(several types, one shown above), the mute Paris Star cancel (as
shown above), the continuous rows of squared dots cancel and the
numeral cancels '1639', '167'(?), '1792', '2221', '2738' and
'3439'</p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratitypeB1.jpg"><img
src="franc2/speratitypeB1.jpg" border="0" width="199"
height="227"></a><br>
Reproduction 'B' can be easily recognized, since the cancel is
always placed in the same position. </p>

<p align="left">I have also seen a 'die-proof' in green of
Reproduction 'B', with the cancel extended below the design of
the stamp. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratitypeC1.jpg"><img
src="franc2/speratitypeC1.jpg" border="0" width="186"
height="213"></a><br>
Reproduction 'C'</p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/typeC.jpg" width="63"
height="48"><br>
Spot of color in one of the pearls at the left hand side of
Reproduction 'C'.</p>

<p align="left">There is a green line below the 'UB' of 'REPUB'
(see also Reproduction 'F', where this is even better visible).
The 'A' of 'FRANC' appears too small. A spot of color appears in
one of the pearls on the left hand side (see enlarged scan
above). There is also a white dot in the left hand side of the
lower left corner ornament. Sperati applied grill cancels to this
Reproduction 'C' forgery (two types) and the continuous grill
cancel. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/fransperatitypeD4.jpg"><img
src="franc2/fransperatitypeD4.jpg" border="0" width="187"
height="213"></a> <a href="franc2/fransperatitypeD2.jpg"><img
src="franc2/fransperatitypeD2.jpg" border="0" width="185"
height="213"></a> <img src="franc2/speratitypeD1.jpg" width="179"
height="207"><br>
Reproduction 'D' of the 15 c value</p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/typeD.jpg" width="45"
height="50"><br>
The break in the upper part of the 'P' of 'REPUB' in Reproduction
'D'. </p>

<p align="left">In the 15 c Reproduction 'D', there is a break in
the upper part of the 'P' of 'REPUB'. The left bottom corner
ornament has a green flaw extending towards the right. There is a
second white dot below the usual one between the 'C' and 'P' of
'15 C POSTES'. On reproduction 'D' the following cancels can be
found: a grill cancel (as shown above), a mute Paris Star cancel
(third image shown above), the Paris Star numeral cancel '8', the
continuous grill cancel, the continuous rows of squared dots
cancel and the numeral dot cancels: '698', '2063' and '2273'. The
cancel '698' is shown above as the second image. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratitypeE.jpg"><img
src="franc2/speratitypeE.jpg" border="0" width="189" height="216"></a><br>
Reproduction 'E' with continuous rows of squared dots cancel.</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'E' seems to be based on
Reproduction 'D'. Although I can't see much due to the heavy
cancel, the forgery shown above does have the 'SPERATI
REPRODUCTION' mark on the backside, together with the indication
'E'. Sperati applied the following cancels to this forgery: the
mute Paris Star cancel, the continuous grill cancel and the
continuous rows of squared dots cancel (as in the forgery shown
above). </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratitypeF1.jpg"><img
src="franc2/speratitypeF1.jpg" border="0" width="183"
height="208"></a><br>
Reproduction 'F' with Paris Star cancel numeral '8'. </p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'F' seems to be based on
Reproduction 'C'. It exists with the grill cancel, the mute Paris
Star cancel and the Paris Star cancel with numeral '8'.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">20 c 1849 issue</h3>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/fransperati1.jpg"><img
src="franc2/fransperati1.jpg" border="0" width="388" height="237"></a><br>
Tete-beche Sperati forgery with Sperati's signature at the back. </p>

<p align="left">Sperati made a forgery of a single stamp
(reproduction 'A') and a tete-beche pair (reproduction 'B') of
this value. Sorry, no images available yet. Reproduction 'A' is
always unused. Reproduction 'B' exists with and without cancels.
The cancels used were grill cancel, the mute Paris Star cancel
and the following numeral cancels '1128', '1792' and '2063'.
Another numeral cancel with unreadable numbers also exists as
well as a red framed cancel. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">40 c 1849 issue</h3>

<p align="left">Three forgeries, namely Reproduction 'A', 'B' and
'C' were made by Sperati of this stamp. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratitypeA4.jpg"><img
src="franc2/speratitypeA4.jpg" border="0" width="183"
height="211"></a><br>
Reproduction 'A' of the 40 c issue</p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/fransperatiproof.jpg"
width="375" height="491"><br>
Die proof in black of Reproduction 'A'.</p>

<p align="left">The cancel on this forgery is always the same and
always has the same position. I've also seen this forgery as a
die-proof in a minisheet (including the cancel) with text
'REPRODUCTION INTERDITE' in violet and the signature of De
Sperati (see image above). </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/fransperatitypeB.jpg"><img
src="franc2/fransperatitypeB.jpg" border="0" width="208"
height="227"></a><br>
Sperati reproduction 'B' with a constant or static cancel. This
is actually a blackprint 'proof' made by Sperati of this forgery.
It was printed on a minisheet with violet 'REPRODUCTION
INTERDITE' on top and the signature of Jean de Sperati below. </p>

<p align="left">Sperati also made a Reproduction B of the 40 c
value. This forgery also has a constant cancel (sorry, no image
available yet). </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/reprodC.jpg"><img
src="franc2/reprodC.jpg" border="0" width="188" height="213"></a><br>
Reproduction 'C' of the 40 c value, this image was taken from a
'die-proof'.</p>

<p align="left">There is a orange blotch below the 'RE' of
'REPUB', furthermore a white blotch below the '0' of the right
'40'. In some examples I have seen the left '4' is badly done.
These forgeries exists with a grill cancel, a mute Paris Star
cancel and the following numeral cancels '692' (this might have
been a cleaned up genuine stamp of lower value), '2063' and
'3300' (this might have been a cleaned up genuine stamp of lower
value). </p>
