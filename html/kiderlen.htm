<hr>

<p>The stamp dealer Paul Kiderlen from Ulm (Germany) was involved
in creating hundreds of fancy covers from exotic countries, all
addressed to him. He seemed to have been active from about 1890
to 1914. They are either with handwritten address or with a
printed address. There is no text on any of these cards and it is
suspected that they were send in bulk from the country of origin
to Ulm and that a helpful postal clerk cancelled the cards with
an Ulm cancel. Some of them still have the unused reply cards
with them. </p>

<p>Similar activities exist from Julius Kinze (Dresden or
Halberstadt?) and Alfred Rieder. </p>

Kiderlen cards from North Borneo (even two with the same date!). </p>

<p align="left">Above a Kiderlen card from Tasmania, similar
postal stationary exists for Rhodesia, North Borneo, Iceland,
Orange Free State, Seychelles, German East Africa, Gibraltar,
Gold Coast, Bahamas, Labuan, Liberia, Grenada, Oil Rivers,
Trinidad and Tobago, Ecuador, Sarawak, Antigua, Western
Australia, Guatemala. Other British colonies and St.Pierre and
Miquelon, Belgian Congo should also exist (I haven't seen them). </p>

<p align="left">In fact, it seems that the great majority of all
foreign covers of that period offered on Ebay adressed to Ulm
(Germany) have Paul Kiderlen as their destination.</p>
