<p align="left">John Stewart Lowden was a stamp forger around
1900-1915 (see 'Philatelic Forgeries, their Lives and Works' by
V.E.Tyler for more details). It is mentioned there that Lowden
also made forged 'C.S.A.R.' overprints and forged cancels on
stamps of the Orange River Colony and Transvaal. <br>
The story about the forged 'C.S.A.R.' overprints can be found in
The Philatelic Record, Vol. XXIX, 1907, pages 35-40.</p>

<p align="left">Lowden did business under various names: Moore
&amp; Co, West End Stamp Company, Herbert Mack &amp; Co, and
George Ellis. In a 1903 trial
(http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?path=sessionsPapers%2F19030908.xml),
he testified as Frank Moore, stamp dealer at 3 Villiers Street
(his later address was 20 Villiers Street). </p>

<p align="left"><strong>Great Britain</strong></p>

<p align="left">A Lowden forgery of the 1 Pound King Edward VII
stamp of Great Britain also exists, made in 1911(?). According to
'Philatelic Forgers, their Lives and Works' by V.E.Tyler, he sold
2,679 copies of them to a stamp dealer and was arrested
afterwards. The printing is rather coarse, the color is sligthly
too light and a this forgery has a forged (impressed) watermark.
The perforation is identical to the genuine stamps. It seems to
be cancelled always with a 'Jersey' concentric cancel. Jersey was
a port where tobacco came into Great Britain. Therefore many 1
Pound stamps were used for this purpose. The forger (Lowden)
pretended that these forgeries were used for this purpose. Often
this forgery is often pasted on a piece of brown paper
(pretending to belong to the tobacco parcels). This forgery is
described in great detail in 'Great Britain Forgery Guide' by J.
Barefoot Ltd. Example of a Lowden forgery:</p>

is hardly visible; usually this forged cancel is much more
clearly applied. </p>

<p>A large number of deceptive forgeries seems to have been
produced by <strong>René Carème </strong>(sometimes wrongly
spelt as Carême, see note below) of Paris, France. They were
marketed by <strong>Lowden</strong> and Henry Revell Harmer of
London, but also by the firms Westend Stamp Co. and Herbert Mack
&amp; Co Ltd. These forgeries were discovered around 1909
(source: Senf's Illustriertes Briefmarken Journal 1909 p. 280).
Around 2 million forged stamps were confiscated in Paris. Some <a
href="fournier1.htm">Fournier</a> forgeries of these stamps can
be found on Bill Claghorns forgery site:
http://www.geocities.com/claghorn1p/NorthBorneo/index.htm. All
values can be found in 'The Fournier Album of Philatelic
Forgeries'. Also a forgery of the '6 cents.' surcharge can be
found in 'The Fournier Album of Philatelic Forgeries'. I'm not
certain if Fournier sold these Carème forgeries, or if he
produced them himself.</p>

Forgeries initially made by Careme for Lowden and later sold by
other stamp dealers such as Fournier</p>

<p align="left">Note: I've seen a poster for 'Automobiles de
Dion-Bouton'. At the left hand bottom the printer <strong>Carème
</strong>has printed: 'Affiches René Carème 110 Avenue

is the correct spelling. </p>

<em>&quot;BOGUS STAMP FACTORY<br>
LONDON, April 23.<br>
Stamp collectors must be on their guard against forged British
North Borneo stamps, a large number of which have lately been
placed on the market. On Saturday, at Bow Street, two stamp
dealers, John Stewart Lowden, of Villiers Street, Strand, and
Henry Harmer, of West-cliff-on-Sea, were charged with conspiracy
to defraud. It was alleged that the defendants had forged British
North Borneo stmps on a extensive scale, and the premises of Mr
Rene Coraine, in Paris, had been visited, with the result that
large numbers were there discovered in the making. The defendants
were remanded.&quot;<br>
</em>Note that the name Careme has been misspelt as Coraine in
this newspaper article. </p>

<p align="left">In the Evening Post, 11 August 1909 we can
further find:<br>
<em>&quot;NORTH BORNEO STAMPS.<br>
John Stewart Lowden and Henry Revell Harmer, stamp dealers, who
were indicted for conspiring to defraud pesrons buying from them
what purported to be British North Borneo stamps, were found not
guilty on Tuesday, and were discharged. A raid was made by the
French police upon premises in the Avenue d'Orleans in Paris, and
between 700,000 and 800,000 British North Borneo stamps in the
course of manufacture were found, together with the machinery for
making and perforating the stamps. At the same time the police
took possession of some correspondence with the firm of Herbert
Mack and Co., giving instructions as to the way in which the
stamps were to be engraved. It was alleged that the accused
traded as Herbert Mack and Co., and as the West End Stamp
Company, Ltd. Both defendants denied that they were aware that
the stamps they were selling were forgeries.&quot;</em></p>

Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Travers Humphreys prosecuted; Mr. Curtis

North Borneo Company.</p>

<p align="left">HARRINGTON V. FORBES, secretary of the British
North Borneo Company. I have been in the employ of the company
over 28 years, 15 as secretary. The company was incorporated by
Royal Charter for the purpose of acquiring sovereign and
territorial rights over a portion of the island of Borneo. On May
12, 1888, the territories to be administered by the company
became a British Protectorate under the name of the State of
North Borneo. The company has from time to time issued stamps,
which are valid for postage and revenue purposes. The first issue
was 1883. In 1887 the company employed Messrs. Blades, East and
Blades to prepare a new issue. This issue was at first confined
to 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 cents., afterwards 3, 5, and 6 cents
were added. Messrs. Blades engraved these stamps and provided the
dies, printing, and paper, and supplied the stamps in sheets of
50 each, perforated. There was a certain amount of waste that was
perhaps not perforated. The 1887 issue continued valid till
March, 1909. In 1893 there was a new issue, prepared by Messrs.
Waterlow. Both issues were available up to March, 1909. Some of
the stamps issued by the company were sold by them to dealers
direct. Some of them were cancelled with an obliterating stamp at
the junction of four stamps, generally speaking. The cancelled
stamps were sold below their face value; unused they were sold at
their face value. We sold stamps in large quantities to a Mr.
Parker. It sometimes happened that the makers sent us some spoilt
or imperfect sheets. We sold some of these to Parker. The company
had no contract with Parker; we entered into different
arrangements with him from time to time.We never constituted
Parker our agent. I do not know either of the two defendants. We
never had any arrangement with either of them with regard to the
sale of stamps, or with the West End Stamp Company, Herbert Mack
and Co., or Herbert Mack and Co., Limited. When this case arose I
handed Inspector Stockley genuine specimens of the 1867 issue. I
know Rene Carame of Paris only by reputation. We have never had
any dealings with him.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Curtis Bennett. I should say the 1887 to
1890 issue were used after 1894 for postage purposes. There was a
considerable stock of that issue. Two orders only were given for
fresh supplies of that issue to Messrs. Blades, East and Blades,
one in July and the other in October, 1894. I should think the
second order was undoubtedly given for the purpose of selling to
Parker. Both were sold to him in October, 1894, so far as my
memory goes. I should be very doubtful whether the lot ordered in
July was for that special purpose. I should say it was ordered in
order to replenish our stock of that particular issue. They were
eventually sold to Parker. They were printed from the original
plates solely for the purpose of sale to dealers. They are
precisely identical with what has been shipped to Borneo. Some
stamps are printed and cancelled purely for sale to dealers, and
the cancellation mark is as nearly as possible exactly similar to
that which would be put upon the stamps if they had in fact come
through the post. Messrs. Blades would return with the stamps
ordered any spoilt or imperfect sheets. These also would be sold
to dealers. Mr. Parker had some. I cannot say whether they bear
some enhanced value in the eyes of a collector. I do not remember
a single instance of their being purposely imperfect. Parker had
not the sole right of giving the 1887-90 issue from the company.
He would not have the right to make any contract with anybody to
sell the whole of that issue to them. If he did so it would look
as if he was an agent of the company. I have heard that there was
some sort of contract between Parker and the West-End Stamp
Company for the sale of North Borneo stamps. I am not prepared to
say that when these stamps were delivered by Parker to the
West-End Stamp Company they were always delivered and paid for at
the offices of the British North Borneo Company. I believe on
many occasions the completion of the arrangement has taken place
from time to time in our offices, possibly in the presence of a
clerk of the company. The cancellation was done at the offices of
the company.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I think you can take it that when
the company gave an order for a new issue, the previous issue was
no longer sent out to Borneo. The 1894 issue made by Waterlow
were shipped to Borneo in order that they might be put in
circulation in January, 1894. I do not suppose we shipped any of
the previous issues after January, 1894. I cannot say positively
whether no further orders were given to Messrs. Blades to reprint
the 1887-89 issue for the purposes of Borneo. If Borneo had
wanted another supply of that issue naturally they would have
been sent out. I have not looked to see if there is any
correspondence from Borneo asking for a further supply of that
issue. As far as my recollection serves, I should say the only
stamps we sent out would be Waterlow's 1894 issue. I do not say
we ceased to print from the 1887-89 plates. The 1894 issue was a
different stamp entirely. The North Borneo Company keep books
containing records of their dealings in stamps. If we had given
an order to Blades, the only record would be an order. We do not
tell Waterlow's or Blades's what we are going to do with certain
stamps. We gave an order in July, 1904, for ourselves. In October
of that year they were sold with others to Parker. That was not a
reprint for Parker. I cannot say as regards the order of July
that it was not a re-issue for postal or revenue purposes of the
company. I did not say at the police court that the reprints of
the 1887 issue made in 1894 were probably made for Mr. Parker.
When my evidence was read to me I took exception to the word
&quot;reprint&quot;. I did not make use of it. I should call it
&quot;further supply&quot;. The further supply of the 1887 issue
in 1894 were probably for Parker. They would be stamps of the
original issue of 1887-89. We had no objection to supplying
stamps for collector's purposes after the new issue came into
existence - quite the contrary. The 1897 issue with Chinese
characters on them, you can hardly call an issue. Perhaps you do
not quite understand the printing of these stamps of 1894; they
are what they call the centre plate and border plate. They are
quite distinct; and in 1897 we made an alteration in the border
plate only. I could not say the date when we surcharged all the
stamps &quot;British Protectorate.&quot; You would not call the
1897 stamps: an issue; it was an overprint. I believe we quite
recently agreed to further supply Mr. Parker with 100,000 sets of
the 1897 issue. I am in no way an authority in stamp collecting.
When I was asked to describe what a reprint was I described it as
far as my knowledge went. I did not describe it as a further
supply. All stamps issued prior to 1894 were demonetised
officially on March 1. Once a stamp has been put out of
circulation it is no longer available for postal purposes. If you
have a fresh supply after that those may be called reprints. That
is my idea.</p>

<p align="left">WILLIAM ACKLAND, London and Brighton Stamp
Company, Hove. I have known Lowden as managing director of the
West End Stamp Company since April last year and Harmer since
June last. I have had transactions with that company in buying
and selling stamps. They were generally done by post. Exhibit 46
is an invoice of stamps which I bought from that company on April
13, 1908. That includes 1,500 sets of four varieties of the 1887
issue of Borneo. The price of the 1,500 sets was five guineas. On
the same invoice are 400 sets of nine varieties, 1887 issue, £6
13s. 4d. I paid that invoice by cheque. On April 27 I received an
invoice for 5,000 sets of four varieties Borneo 1887, £12 10s. I
paid for those. In May I also bought from them 1,750 sets, four
varieties Borneo 1887, price five guineas, and 430 sets of nine
varieties, same issue, £5 7s. 6d. That invoice was paid by
exchanges. In September I received another invoice, which
included 1,000 sets, four varieties of the 1887 issue, 400 sets,
nine varieties, price £5. In October there was an invoice for
8,000 sets, four varieties 1887 issue, price £8, and 2,000 sets
of nine varieties, price £33 6s. 8d. There was an error in the
pricing of these. Lowden called at my address with the October
transaction stamps. He left them with me. I think most of them
are in stock still - the forged ones. I sold some of them to a
Mr. Brown, of Salisbury, about August last. I received a
communication from Mr. Brown with regard to those stamps, and in
consequence I came to London and saw Lowden about October 2 or 3
I told him I had heard from a correspondent who thought the 1887
issues were not genuine. Lowden said, &quot;Oh, they are all
right, I got them from the Borneo Company with the other sorts of
Borneo's except a few I bought here and there to complete broken
sets.&quot; He also said some he had received from the Borneo
Company were without perforations, so he thought they might be
reprints or printer's waste. They were not sold to me as reprints
but as genuine original stamps. I said, &quot;If those stamps are
reprints I cannot send them out to my customers as genuine.&quot;
He said, &quot;You can send them out all right.&quot; &quot;Send
them out without comment,&quot; I think were the words he used. I
might say at the same time I told him I had heard from a
correspondent that the stamps had been submitted to a firm in
London who pronounced them genuine. I told him that because I was
surprised to hear from Mr. Brown, that there was any doubt about
these stamps. I have had sixteen years' experience as a stamp
dealer. There is a great difference between the prices of
reprints and originals. The former usually cost a fraction of the
value of the latter. I could not tell you what would be the price
of reprints of the 1887 issue. I never heard of any being on the
market. I do not deal in reprints. Until the interview I had with
Lowden in October I never heard about the stamps I bought from
them being printer's waste. They were sold to me amongst hundreds
of other stamps without any special designation or explanation. I
think all the others were perfectly genuine. On September 24
invoice they describe &quot;two sets of errors, Labuan, 8s.&quot;
The North Borneo's have no description such as &quot;waste,&quot;
&quot;reprints&quot; &quot;errors,&quot; or anything of that
sort. I therefore understood they were perfectly genuine. Exhibit
40 are the stamps I handed to Inspector Stockley. They came from
the West End Stamp Company.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Curtis Bennett, The firm in London to whom
my correspondent sent some stamps stated that in their opinion
they were genuine. That is Stanley Gibbons, a firm of repute.
Errors and reprints are quite different things. No doubt the
particular errors I bought from the West End Stamp Company are
described as errors in Stanley Gibbons' catalogue. The price I
was paying for these prints was between 25s. and 33s. 4d. per 100
sets of nine. On one occasion I bought 8,000 sets of four for
£24; that is less than a penny a set. That is not the price of
reprints as far as I know. I would not give anything for reprints
myself. I do not think there is a large market for reprints.
Lowden told me in October that some of the stamps might be
reprints or printer's waste. I understand he was referring to the
unperforated ones. It is untrue that Lowden told me when I first
bought from him that he was going to sell me stamps which were
reprints. It must be untrue, because I never buy reprints. During
the last 12 months I suppose I have bought about £1,200 worth of
stamps from the West End Stamp Company. Of that amount about
£100 worth are alleged forgeries.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I believe there are a large
number of works upon reprints. I know something about reprints of
some stamps. There may be instances of them being of value, but
in most cases they are of very little value. I believe Stanley
Gibbons are about the best known authority on stamps. I have
never read their book on reprints. I have never heard of
&quot;Annie Hills on Reprint. &quot;I paid under a 1d. a set for
the 8,000 sets of four. I think retailers try and get 2d. or 3d.
a set for them. I have not heard that Mr. Brown carries on
business as Bright and Sons. I believe Bright and Sons are
members of the Stamp Trade Protection Association. I suppose they
are interested in this prosecution, but I am not quite certain
who is interested in it.\</p>

<p align="left">WILLIAM BROWN (1, St. Thomas Square, Salisbury).
I have been in business 25 years. I have done business with the
West End Stamp Company I know, Harmer has been connected with
that firm. I do not know Lowden personally. Exhibit 66 represents
a transaction between myself and the West End Stamp Company in
the 1886 issue of Borneo stamps. Exhibit 67 is a letter signed by
Harmer and relates to the stamps referred to in Exhibit 66. These
are low values of the 1887 issue, a thought the invoice calls
them 1886. I sent out some of those stamps in the ordinary course
of business to customers, amongst others to a Mr. Renault, of
Brussels. He returned them. I wrote about this to the West End
Stamp Company. They replied, &quot;In reply to your letter of
October 17, we are perfectly satisfied as to the genuineness of
the stamps, but as you raise a doubt as to the matter we will
take them back and credit you with the amount. Probably you are
not aware there were several reprints of this issue.&quot; I
wrote Harmer personally about these stamps afterwards. I had some
dealings with last witness. About July or August last I bought
from him 1887 issue North Borneo stamps. I returned the whole of
them. I draw a distinction between genuine stamps and reprints. I
was never told by anyone on behalf of the West End Stamp Company
that I was buying reprints. I did not know they were reprints.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Curtis Bennett. He pointed out in his
letter that there were several reprints of that issue, speaking
of reprints as distinct from genuine stamps. When I buy cancelled
stamps I do not think I am buying stamps which have actually been
through the post. I do not think they have been specially printed
for collectors. The stamps were cancelled exactly as if they had
a postmark on them. They are generally specially printed for
collectors. If printed from the original plates I would call them
genuine. Reprints are printed from the original plates. It is the
custom of the trade if any fault is found with stamps that have
been sold for the money to be returned. No money passed in my
case. I got credit for it. I sell packets of 1,000 different
stamps. The price varies to dealers and collectors. The latter
pay 10s. 6d. for them. They are described as genuine. I do not
know if I could afford to put in that packet a 50 cents brown
Panama stamp of the 1888-91 issue, which is priced at 2s. in a
book sold by me; it depends entirely what it cost me. I should
not put in it knowingly. I do not make up the packets myself.<br>
Re-examined. I do not deal in reprints.</p>

<p align="left">OTTO E. T. KUHN. I am 15 years of age and a
scholar at Westminster School. About two years ago I saw in
&quot;Boys' Life&quot; an advertisement of Mack and Co., stamp
dealers. I got into communication with them, and bought sixpenny
packets of stamps nearly every month. Some contained North Borneo
stamps. I handed Inspector Stockley one of the packets. I also
got approval sheets from them similar to Exhibit 14. Sometimes
there were North Borneo stamps on them.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Curtis Bennett. Last year I was taking in
&quot;Mack's Stamp Review.&quot; It contained articles attacking
and exposing persons for dealing in forged stamps. I saw that two
of the persons attacked were said to be members of the Stamp
Trade Protection Association and that their names had been given
to the directors of that association for the purpose of inquiry.
The articles pointed out what the stamps were and what the
forgeries were. The sixpenny packets contained about 100 stamps.
I cannot remember if they contained only three Borneo stamps.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I have taken an interest in
stamps for some little time. I have read no other publication
issued for collectors except &quot;Mack's Stamp Review. &quot;I
might not know if a stamp I got was printed some time after the
original issue. I have not complained in this case. I have not
suggested that I have been defrauded, or that people have made
untrue representations. It would surprise me to know that
somebody had suggested that I had.</p>

<p align="left">CYRIL WOODHOUSE, Lansdowne Road, Hackney. I am a
stamp collector, and in my spare time I sell and exchange stamps.
I have dealt with Mack and Co. for about 18 months. I have seen
Lowden at 20, Villiers Street, more than once. I have bought from
him North Borneo stamps in packets and small lots. Exhibit 65
contains a number of stamps which I handed to one of the police
officers in this case. These 12 sheets and loose stamps were sent
to me by post by Herbert Mack and Co. I bought them, believing
them to be genuine.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I cannot say the date of my first
transaction in Borneo stamps. I never dealt specially in them. I
have studied stamp collecting. I know there are reprints of old
issues, that they are valuable at times and difficult to get. I
would have no objection to purchasing a stamp which had been
produced from a plate after it had been issued to the public, at
a very reduced price of course. I suppose I paid the usual
wholesale prices. If I got a set of four North Borneo for a penny
it would be cheap, I suppose, if I bought them as stamps. If they
came on a sheet with nothing said beyond the price I should think
I had got a bargain. I used to make bargains even when dealing
with wholesale dealers. I should sell them at the same price as
marked on the sheets. The sheets were priced at 10s. each; I paid
1s. I took them off and put them in books. I did not trouble
whether they were reprints or reissues.</p>

<p align="left">HENRY BURGESS, managing clerk to Bright and Sons,
164, Strand, My principals instructed me to write to H. Mack, 20,
Villiers Street, in January last. I wrote in the name of W.
Plummer from my private address. My wife wrote the letter at my
dictation. In reply I received a book of North Borneo stamps. I
took from the book a set at the price of 1s. 3d. and returned the
book with the 1s. 3d. After that I got another book on approval
(Exhibit 43). It has on the front cover inside, &quot;All stamps
guaranteed genuine.&quot; The price was £9 9s. 6d. I offered
them £3, which they accepted. I did not believe they were
genuine Borneo stamps. I am not an expert. I was simply acting on
instructions.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Curtis Bennett. I do not express any
opinion even now as to whether these stamps are genuine or
otherwise. I handed the book to my employers. The first book I
handed to them and the stamps were put in stock. So far as I know
they may be sold. The second book I only just looked at.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I have been in the stamp trade
six or seven years. Possibly during that time hundreds of
thousands of stamps have passed through my hands. Stamps of the
same issue may differ in colour, not in size. Various
perforations exist in most stamps. Bright and Sons issue a
catalogue. I do not remember their prices for North Borneo off
hand. I should think their price for 1890 Borneo £ cent or 1
cent, would be 1d. or 2d., the 2 cents 2d. or 3d., the 3 cents
about 3d.<br>
Re-examined. We allow discounts off the catalogue prices
according to quantity purchased; 50 per cent, is the usual
discount with some firms. Very often the original price is put
high in order to allow that discount. The nominal price in the
catalogue does not necessarily mean the price we would get.</p>

<p align="left">WILLIAM A. STEWART, clerk in the office of the
Registrar of Joint Stock Companies. I produce the file of the
West End Stamp Company. It was registered January 22, 1906. John
Stewart Lowden, 15, Curzon Road, Weybridge, is the first
subscriber; 20, Villiers Street, Strand, is the registered
office. According to the return filed in May, 1908, Lowden held
510 £1 shares; Henry Revell Harmer, Preston Road, Southend,
2,998 shares. The directors are stated to be J. S. Lowden, Mary
Ethel Lowden, and Harmer in 1906, and in 1907 there were only
two, Lowden and Harmer. On June 21. 1906, there is a resolution
on the file that Harmer and Lowden shall be the joint managing
directors of the company. There is no return after May 4, 1908.
There is no notice of either of them having resigned. I have here
also the file of Mack and Co., Limited, registered May 20, 1905;
capital £100 in £1 shares. Neither Lowden or Harmer are
signatories. No return of shareholders has ever been filed. The
directors are stated to be Alfred Edward Boyce, 16, Alexandra
Road, Twickenham, and Augusta Pile, Arundel Terrace,
Southend-on-Sea.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. Harmer is not a signatory of the
original articles of the West End Stamp Company. There is an
Agreement by which Harmer sold his business to the company, dated
May 2, 1906. Harmer took shares in the purchasing company. If we
are not notified of a change in the directorate it is a breach of
the law.</p>

<p align="left">JOSIAH D. WATTS, Notary Public, 5, Nicholas Lane,
E. C. Exhibit 37 is a statutory declaration made before me on
December 31, 1908, by J. S. Lowden, 20, Villiers Street, Strand
As I said at the police court, I should not like to be sure I
recognise Lowden, but his face seems familiar. (Statutory
declaration read.)</p>

<p align="left">JOHN WALLIS, 59, Finsbury Pavement. I have done
business with the West End Stamp Company for some years. I sold
them genuine North Borneo stamps in 1907; I think they were the
1887 issue. On that occasion I dealt with Harmer. The price was
£3 11s. and something for 150 sets. I saw him several times
after that. About nine or ten months after that transaction he
proposed to return some of the stamps I had sold. He said he did
not require them. They had not been paid for. I agreed to take
back the 150 sets on his giving me 26 extra sets. Part of these
are Exhibit 41, which I handed to Inspector Stockley.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Curtis Bennett. I have not done business in
North Borneo stamps with Lowden.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I have done considerable business
with Harmer. I have never had any reason to complain. He had a
very good business and occupied a good position in the trade. So
far as I know the stamps I sold to the West End Stamp Company
were not returned to me; I believe they sold them. It was a good
while afterwards that they told me they had no need for them. I
believe what I got Back were forgeries. I am certain they are not
the same stamps. I got mine from a gentleman on the Stock
Exchange, who had them some years. I do not know a good deal
about stamps - just a little. Compared with the trade in genuine
stamps I should not say there is not quite a large market for
reprints. A reprint is supposed to come from the original plate.
They form the best substitute you can get of the original issue.
They more often than not vary in colour from the original. In
most cases they vary in paper. The perforation is sometimes
different. I do not know about the size. I know that many States
and companies who have printed their own stamps have afterwards
sold the plates to dealers, who have reprinted stamps from the
plates and put them on the market. Those are recognised as
reprints- that is all. Apart from getting these differences in
reprints, there are differences in the originals themselves in
colour. I have not noticed differences in size. If I were
purchasing as a dealer North Borneo stamps at something, under a
1d. a set of four I should think it a very low price. If I knew
the stamps were going in large quantities at that price I should
suppose there was something up, knowing the stamps to be very
scarce. I should not think they were the original issue. I should
think £24 for 8,000 sets was nearer the reprint price than the
genuine. For a set of nine I ask 1s. 6d. retail. I have never
handled the small sets. I should say reprints were of undoubted
philatelic value when the stamps are genuine and difficult to
get. At the time these stamps were dealt in I considered them
scarce.<br>
Re-examined. I have never bought as many as 8,000 sets at a time
of North Borneo stamps. If I had done so I should expect to get
them very much cheaper than if I were buying a few sets; 1s. 6d.
a set is my price for my window and catalogue, to the trade it
would be 1s. If I sold 5,000 sets I should take a profit on what
I gave for them. The price would vary enormously between one set
and 8,000 sets. This particular set is scarce and very difficult
to get in quantities. I know Parker. He has none of these stamps
now. The only ones I bought were from that gentleman on the Stock
Exchange. I tried to get them elsewhere. I did not apply to the
West End Stamp Company for them. It would be no good when they
were applying to me for them. I did not know they had any in 1908
- just a few hundred I thought they had. I did not ask how many
they had got.</p>

<p align="left">HENRY GRIEVE PARKER, 35, Linthorpe Road, Stamford
Hill. I have known Harmer five or six years and Lowden about
three years. I was introduced to Lowden by Harmer at Villiers
Street, I believe. I have had dealings with the West End Stamp
Company in connection with which I have seen both defendants at
different times. I have bought considerable quantities of British
North Borneo stamps from the British North Borneo Company. I
bought some of the 1887-89 issue of all the values from 1/2 cent
upwards. I bought them in sheets of 50, both perforated and
unperforated, cancelled and not cancelled. No doubt I bought some
in 1887. They were valuable unused. The last time I bought any of
that issue would be in 1894 or 1895. I was never the agent of the
company. I was an independent buyer of stamps from them. I had no
other relations with them. I had an agreement with the West End
Stamp Company, or two agreements, for the sale to them of some of
the stamps which I bought from the North Borneo Company. Exhibit
59 is the first agreement. That is signed by Lowden and Harmer
and witnessed by E. Neumann (agreement read). Exhibit 60 is a
supplementary agreement dated June 4, 1908. Under this agreement
there was a question of interest to be paid by them on some
unpaid sum of money. I began at once to make monthly deliveries
of the stamps which I bought from the North Borneo Company. On
December 5 I got a deposit of £800 and then practically once a
month up to January, 1908, 1 got £200. The next payments were in
June, September. October, November, 1908, then January and April,
1909, £200 on each occasion. There was no interest due until six
months afterwards. The January parcel was not taken up, and
according to the agreement that carried 5 per cent interest. For
the February parcel I have been paid £200. The March, April,
May, and June parcels carry 5 per cent, interest. Since the date
of that agreement I have not sold these stamps to others than the
West End Stamp Company. I had a monopoly of the 1887 issues for a
short time. I held the entire stock. The cancelled stamps which I
sold to the West End Stamp Company were sold at considerably
under their face value.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Curtis Bennett. I was not an agent at all
of the North Borneo Company. I had a monopoly of the 1887 issue
for certain periods. At the time I entered into the agreement
with the West End Stamp Company I did not think I had a monopoly
of the 1887 issue. I think it had expired years ago. The stock of
the 1887 issue I sold years and years ago, with the exception of
some unperforated stamps. I agreed with Lowden and Harmer not to
sell any of the said cancelled stamps or any variety, or re-issue
to any person, company, or firm. As to the word
&quot;re-issue&quot; entitling me to a monopoly of any re-issue
the company might make, I say the company can make as many
re-issues as they like. In putting in the agreement that any of
the said cancelled stamps or variety or re-issue would not be
sold to anybody else by me, it was a trade risk I was willing to
take. I was willing to take the risk that the company did not
make re-issues of any of their stamps. I did not think the
company would print any more. If the company did make a re-issue
the West End Stamp Company had the option, if they liked, of
taking legal proceedings against me. That is a trade risk I took.
At that time I did not know anybody else was dealing with the
North Borneo Company in this issue. I bought them from the
company to do just whatever I liked with; I could burn them if I
liked, but I bought them with the intention of selling to
collectors and dealers. I do not know that the North Borneo
Company was specially printing stamps to my order in July and
October, 1894. I have not heard Mr. Forbes's evidence. I have
heard something about it. I daresay I bought a quantity from the
company in October, 1894. I have no books to show this; it is a
long time ago. I have not looked to see. I may have sold to
persons other than the West End Stamp Company, but not since the
agreement was signed. Amongst the stamps I sold to the defendants
were all the unperforated stamps of the 1887 issue. Occasionally
for convenience I delivered these stamps at the North Borneo
Company's office, and the money was paid over there. The fact
that I had an agreement with the defendants was known to one, at
any rate, of the clerks of the North Borneo Company. I said at
the police court I was under the impression that the higher
values were genuine, that the higher values had passed through my
hands and the lower values might have done. That is what I say
now.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I could not consider that by the
agreement I contract with the defendants to supply them with any
re-issue by the North Borneo Company. I agree it is a contract to
supply defendants with any re-issues that I get of that issue. I
undertake not to supply any other person at all with those
particular stamps subject to the payments being kept up, of
course. I did not assert that I had a monopoly, although I had
for the time being. The object of the clause was that if the
company did at any time re-issue any of these stamps the West End
Stamp Company were able to bring an action against me for
damages. I do not know that North Borneo stamps were re-issued to
me. There might have been a re-issue without my knowledge, and I
might have bought the stamps afterwards. I said at the
police-court, &quot;There were some stamps specially printed to
my order a few months ago. They wore the current issue,
1897.&quot; That is true. Why I told you just now so positively
that North Borneo's had not been issued was because I was under
that impression, and so I am now, but you are talking of the 1887
issue. I do not know if 1887 North Borneo stamps were ever
re-issued to me. The last that were issued were the current
issue. The stamps that were reprinted for me were the current
issue, with the exception of being surcharged&quot; British
Protectorate.&quot; The stamps I wanted were not surcharged. I
asked the company whether they could oblige me by giving me some.
If I had wanted the word&quot; Labuan&quot; printed upon them
they would not do it. Labuan is out of the jurisdiction of the
North Borneo Company. Several years ago I got stamps from the
North Borneo Company with the word &quot;Labuan&quot; stamped
upon them. That was not done to my order. I did not have the word
left out to my order. &quot;Labuan&quot; is on the plate, and
that plate has been destroyed a long time ago I believe. It is a
separate island. The North Borneo Company do not issue stamps for
it now (plate with &quot;Labuan&quot; on produced). I understood
you were talking about the 1 to 24 cent, stamps printed by
Waterlows. It is a pity I did not see the Exhibit then, as I
should not have been under the impression I was. Those stamps
were printed and surcharged afterwards. That is the 1895 issue.
The 1 to 24 cents, are Waterlows; the others are Blades. None of
the stamps were stamped &quot;Labuan&quot; to my order. The word
was not left off to my order at any time. The high value
&quot;Labuan&quot; stamps, which I presume you are talking about
at the present time, were in the office, and I bought up the
remaining stock. No high value stamps of Labuan have ever been
printed for me. I have only given one order for stamps to be
reprinted; that was last year, but I have had contracts with the
company to supply me with stamps. I daresay I have had contracts
with people and have charged them for the printing of the stamps.
I make out my invoices just as I like. I can sell stamps by the
square foot, yard, weight, or anyhow. I had a contract with Mr.
Penny and charged him for printing and cancelling. I do not think
they were printed and cancelled to my order. In that particular
instance I might have paid so much a thousand for the stamps, and
so much per dollar, so much for printing, and so much for
cancelling. The company themselves did not get any of the
cancelling money; it was done by private arrangement between the
company's clerks and myself for them to do it in their spare
time. They were cancelled to my order. Penny paid me for the
printing. He is not the only person to whom I made out invoices
in that way. I have dealt in other stamps besides North Borneo. I
have a fair knowledge of certain kinds of foreign stamps I have
dealt in. It has been known that authorities in native States and
South American States after printing stamps frequently dispose of
their plates to dealers, such as Salvador and Nicaragua.
Bergedorf used to be a little native State before the German
Empire was established. I do not know about books being specially
printed dealing with the numerous cases where plates have been
sold to dealers. &quot;Stanley Gibbons on Reprints&quot; has no
interest to me; it might exist. It is the fact that in addition
to the regular stamps printed by Blades I got printers waste and
all spoilt copies. I have noticed in very many foreign stamps the
colours differ. I will not go so far as to say there are
differences in size. I have not taken the trouble to compare. You
can only tell some reprints by the difference in perforation, but
some reprints that were made by the original printers for stamp
dealers have the same perforation as the original one. There have
been different shades of colour in the North Borneo stamps. I
have noticed them myself.<br>
Re-examined. In 1894 the West End Stamp Company were not
established. I did not buy from the North Borneo Company in
October, 1894, for the purpose of selling to Harmer or Lowden.
The stock I then bought were all disposed of fully ten years ago,
with the exception of some imperforated ones which the West End
Stamp Company were to take under their agreement. I had some
unperforated stamps of the 1887 issue at the time of the
agreement. I had sold small quantities to various people before
that date. The last I bought from the North Borneo Company was
about 1894. I do not think the company have issued a single stamp
of that issue since 1894. If they had done so I think it would
have come to my knowledge. I did not think for a single moment
they would, and I do not think so now. In September, 1907, I held
of all denominations perhaps 100,000 or 150,000, not in
sets&#151;odd values to a certain extent&#151;1/2 cent to 10
dollars, of the 1887 issue, both perforated and imperforated. By
the agreement I entered into some were Borneo and some Labuan. I
sold to the West End Stamp Company the whole stock of those
issues that I possessed (Exhibit 43 handed to witness). I cannot
recognise whether these stamps have ever passed through my hands.
It is impossible. If they are all genuine they have passed
through my hands. I have not examined them critically. If they
have not been printed by the North Borneo Company they have not
passed through my hands. I have never bought stamps from Mr.
Carame, of Paris. I never heard his name mentioned till the
commencement of this year, or the end of last year. Every single
stamp I sold to the West End Stamp Company came from the North
Borneo Company. The stamps I sold to Mr. Penny were printed by
the North Borneo Company. I have never heard of the Transvaal
selling their plates. I never heard of the British North Borneo
Company selling their plates; I wish I had the opportunity of
buying them.<br>
Further cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I do not know what I
should have done if I could have bought the North Borneo
Company's plates. In addition to the 1887 unperforated stamps I
have supplied defendants with stamps of all issues from 1887
onwards.</p>

<p align="left">Inspector JAMES STOCKLBY, Scotland Yard. On April
13 I went to 11, Preston Road, Westcliff-on-Sea, where Harmer
lives. I got a warrant for his arrest on April 3. The warrant
charged the two defendants with conspiracy. I saw Harmer there,
told him I had a warrant for his arrest and read the warrant to
him. I told him it had been granted at the request of the
Director of Public Prosecutions. Harmer asked me who the persons
were that were complaining of being defrauded. I said Mr. Brown,
of Salisbury, was one of the parties mentioned in the information
upon which the warrant had been granted. He said, &quot;Yes, I
have done some business with him. I think you are wrong. There is
an explanation to all this. I suppose you know I severed my
connection with Mr. Lowden some time ago.&quot; He took me
upstairs into the office. I found there stamps and
correspondence. I took possession of them. Amongst others were
some North Borneo stamps on the table. I brought him to Bow
Street. The same evening I saw Lowden in Villiers Street. He
already knew me. I told him I was going to arrest him upon a
warrant granted at Bow Street, and went with him into his office,
where I read it to him. I told him also that it had been granted
at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions and he
asked who the persons were who were supposed to be defrauded. I
said Mr. Ackland, of Brighton, was one of the persons mentioned
in the Information. He said, &quot;I know him; this is a very bad
business.&quot; That was at the office of the West End Stamp
Company and Mack and Co. I searched the office in his presence
and took possession of a large quantity of stamps, books, and
letters. In a cupboard I found a large quantity of British North
Borneo stamps of the 1887-90 issue, 1/2 to 10 cents. They were
put apart. When I found them Lowden said, &quot;These are the
ones all the trouble is about.&quot; At Harmer's premises I did
not find any of the 1887 issue. At Lowden's premises there were
92,000 odd. They were put in different packets and marked
different Exhibits. In this envelope the 4 cents are not the 1887
issue. The numbers of the different denominations were pretty
evenly distributed except the 10 cents, of which I found only
2,061. They were all sealed up in small envelopes. I opened them
for inspection. I identify the various Exhibits. On April 14 I
went again to Villiers Street. I found Miss Neumann there, who is
a clerk employed by the company. She was dealing with the morning
letters. Some of the letters were opened in my presence and found
to contain approval sheets sent back by persons to whom they had
been sent exactly similar to Exhibit 16. I asked Miss Neumann to
let me view as she opened them. They were returned in the firm's
printed envelopes. I also found two albums containing stamps of
all countries, including North Borneo 1887 issue. I also found
the memorandum and articles of association of the West End Stamp
Company, Limited, press copy, letter books, and several copies of
&quot;Mack's Stamp Review. &quot;I also found books of the West
End Stamp Company, Limited; others were subsequently handed to me
by Mr. Lowden. When I was searching the office on the evening of
Lowden's arrest I asked him where the books were. He said he had
not got them, because he had sold the business to a Mr.
Schneider. He said he had sold it for £10. I asked him who
Schneider was, and where he lived. He said he did not
know&#151;somewhere in the Gray's Inn Road. I continued the
search and found the books. He handed me the other books some
days after he was charged and bailed out. I have been through the
books. I find no entry of any sale to Schneider. While at
Lowden's office I found some paid cheques on the London and
South-Western Bank pasted to the counterfoils, ranging from 1897
to December, 1908. Some are signed by Harmer and some by Lowden,
as directors of the West End Stamp Company. Some of those cheques
are payable to Rene Carame. I also found a bill-book. In that
book I found entries of bills payable. Rene Carame's name is not
there. I found two bills which were pasted in the cheque-book.
Exhibit 26 is a bill for 1,000 francs paid April 8, 1908,
accepted by Harmer as director, drawn by Carame. The other bill
is of the same date, for 1, 000 francs, accepted by Harmer, and
drawn by Carame. I found also a large number of cheques paid to
Mr. Parker between May, 1907, and August, 1908. I also found a
number of cheques between May and October, 1907, the counterfoils
of which are marked &quot;Expenses for Mr. Harmer in Paris.&quot;
The last one is July, 1908. The seven stamps and photographic
enlargements produced were handed to me by Mr. Calcas, of the
French Police. Exhibit 34 are copies made from press copy letter
books. The letters in Exhibit 34 purport to be translations into
English of letters in Exhibit 23, pages 477, 480, 483, 516, and
544, written in German by Lowden to Carame. I know Lowden's
signature. The statutory declaration, I believe, is signed by
Lowden. I received from the secretary of the North Borneo Company
specimens of their genuine stamps.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Curtis Bennett. The stamps I found in the
cupboard were not handed to me. I have not formed an idea of the
number of stamps I found there; I seized a great quantity of
various countries besides the Borneo. I found the books in a
drawer in Miss Neumann's desk. I think it was at the court that
Lowden said if I called I might have the other books. I have not
heard that Monsieur Gay was the gentleman who introduced Carame
to the defendants. In the bill-book I find in April, 1908, a bill
for 1,000 francs due April 18 entered as M. Gay. I find on the
next bill the name of &quot;Rene Carame, impressions de
luxe&quot; and his address in Paris. That bill seems to have been
through several persons' hands, stamps of banks, etc.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Prampton. I found no Borneo stamps of the
1887 issue at Harmer's. </p>

<p align="left">Detective-sergeant SIDNEY WYBORN. I received from
the witness Woodhouse a number of stamps which I handed to
Inspector Stockley, which are Exhibit 65. Exhibit 41 are those I
received from the witness Wallis.</p>

<p align="center">(Monday, June 28.)</p>

<p align="left">ALPHONSE CALCAS, of the Paris Police. On December
22 last I went to 110, Avenue D'Orleans, the premises occupied by
Rene Carame. I saw him there. There were also some workmen and
workgirls engaged in printing North Borneo stamps. The police
seized a quantity of material there. We seized the stamp
perforator produced and about 700,000 or 800,000 stamps in course
of fabrication. They were all North Borneo stamps of different
series; 1, 2, 8, and 10 cents all of the same issue. I gave
Inspector Stockley a few of them. We also found a large amount of
correspondence, some signed by Harmer and some &quot;Mack and
Company. &quot;All those in French and German have been
translated. In consequence of what Carame said to me I went to
28, Rue de Grevier, the address of Galen, a printer. There I
found some large lithographic stones, on which were
representations of stamps found at Carame's. (Stone produced.)
Carame is being prosecuted in France. He has been examined by the
Juged' Instruction many times.</p>

<p align="left">JOSEPH CORAZZA, director of Gatti, Stevenson, and
Slater, Limited. My company is the superior landlord of 20,
Villiers Street. Before June, 1907, Lowden leased those premises;
he surrendered the lease in that month.<br>
Cross-examined. They have spent a considerable sum on the
premises.</p>

<p align="left">THOMAS MACDONALD, 6, Barnsbury Terrace,
Barnsbury. I have been employed from time to time to design and
engrave for Blades, East and Blades. I designed and engraved the
whole of the North Borneo 1887 to 1889 issue. (Plates produced.)
The stamps are produced by the lithographic process, otherwise
they could not have had this forgery as it is now. I have
examined a great number of stamps submitted to me in this case.
This exhibit are genuine stamps printed from the original plates.
No. 28 are all forgeries. I am able to point out clear
differences and discrepancies between the two. In the forgeries
different methods of treatment appear. I should say they were of
different workmanship. One man is more clever than the other. The
principal has done one part and he has had assistants to do other
parts. He had assistants to do those corners, and some assistants
to do the lettering, and when the card is finished he places
those things in position so that they can be all photographed
together. Those things would be quite simple, but they have been
badly done. I have examined the specimens from Mr. Ackland. The
series 1/2 to 10 cents of 1887 issue are all forgeries, and from
the same original. The envelope also contains photographic
enlargements with stamps attached, which were made for the
purposes of this case. The same remarks apply to Exhibits 41 and
42. I do not think Exhibit 43 are genuine stamps produced from
our plates, but they are not the same as the others. There are
some differences in the sizes. (The witness explained the process
of producing the stamps, and declared various exhibits to be
forgeries.)<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I found differences in the size
and colour in the 1/2 to 10 cents in Exhibit 43. I am not a
printer. The paper may vary. Odd sheets may make a little
difference, but, if they are all of the same make, very little. I
did not specially examine the stamps taken from the stones at
Messrs. Blades. I have had great quantities of them through my
hands. If one of our plates were handed over to another printer
or lithographer I do not think he would do it so negligently as
to cause differences in the production of the impression; you
might get it badly printed, but I do not think you would get a
difference in size. (The witness explained the process of
colouring.) If the North Borneo Company sold their waste it would
not be genuine. It should be burnt.</p>

<p align="left">WILLIAM CROMACK, lithographic manager to Messrs.
Blades. The plates that were engraved for the 1887 issue were
kept in a special safe with bank-note plates until they were
applied for; perhaps they had to go to Mr. Macdonald for some
alteration or sent direct to the North Borneo Company, according
to instructions. We had the plates in the early part of the year
when I first heard of this case. They were then given up. They
were signed for by each person through whose hands they went.
(The witness explained the process of printing and the
differences between the forgeries and the genuine.)</p>

<p align="left">HENRY WILLIAM TYLER. I am in charge of the paper
department of Messrs. Blades. The paper used for printing the
North Borneo stamps of the 1887-90 issue was called 24 mill 15
lb. cream wove medium. All the sheets were identical. The paper
is counted over twice before it comes to my department, and is
counted again when it goes to the printing department. After they
are printed they go to be gummed and perforated. When completed
they go to the North Borneo Company. They have to be accounted
for right through.</p>

<p align="left">ETHEL FRANCES PIX. I was lady clerk employed at
20, Villiers Street. I was engaged by both Mr. Lowden and Mr.
Harmer for the West End Stamp Company. I started in September,
1907, and remained there until just before Christmas last. Both
Harmer and Lowden managed the business. When I left I was really
transferred to other offices down below, Herbert Mack and Co. Mr.
Lowden chiefly looked after the business of Herbert Mack and Co.
I think Mr. Harmer had left then. I used to make approval sheets
and books and repair them. Mr. Lowden used to give me the stamps
to stick on the approval sheets. They were then sent out to
customers with the price of each stamp marked. They were then
sent back by the customers and any blanks had to be paid for. The
blanks would then be filled up with stamps from stock. Exhibit 14
is the sort of thing. I used to put the prices on. I had a sheet
given me as a sample, usually by Mr. Lowden. I remember giving
some sheets to Inspector Stockley in April. I have not the
slightest idea where Lowden got the stamps to give to me. Mr.
Harmer was absent sometimes. I do not remember about Mr. Lowden.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Curtis Bennett. The West-End Stamp Company
was a wholesale business. Herbert Mack and Co. was a retail
business.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. When I was transferred to Mack
and Co. I think Harmer had left.</p>

<p align="left">MARGARET SELBY. I was clerk at 20, Villiers
Street, from early in 1907 onwards in the employment of H. Mack
and Co. I had nothing to do with the West End Stamp Company,
Limited. Both Mr. Harmer and Mr. Lowden gave me directions. I
used to make up and sent out approval sheets. Exhibit 14 are the
sort of things I used to send out. There was a book in which I
used to enter the name of the person to whom each sheet was sent
on approval. Each sheet had a number so as to enable me to
identify the person. I do not put the stamps in the books
(Exhibit 43); I simply send them out. I think Mr. Harmer came to
the office regularly until about last September. After that he
came occasionally.</p>

<p align="left">ELLA NEUMANN. I was first employed as clerk at
20, Villiers Street, in May, 1906. Mr. Lowden was carrying on the
business of the West End Stamp Company. Mr. Harmer went there the
same time as I did. H. Mack and Company, Limited, was not
carrying on business in the same offices when we went there.
Afterwards they used the same offices. I kept the books of the
West End Stamp Company. In this ledger there is an account of Mr.
Wm. Brown, of Salisbury. The goods sold to him are entered there.
There is also an account of the London and Brighton Stamp
Company. There is no entry of any dealings with Mr. Carame, of
Paris. I have heard the name of Carame from Harmer and Lowden. I
used to write letters from dictation in French and German. Mr.
Lowden does not know either of those languages, Harmer knows
German. I used to write to Mr. Carame. Mr. Harmer dictated them
as long as he was there. After he left Mr. Lowden dictated them
in English. I used to write them in French at first, then in
German. I did the translation. I have seen the bundle of letters,
Exhibit 31, and been through them. The typed ones are typed by
me. Nos. 4, 20, 7, and 33 are Harmer's writing. The signature is
typed. I do not think there ever was any handwriting on the typed
letters. They are signed with a stamp. I used to type letters for
H. Mack and Company, although employed by the West End Stamp
Company. There are a number of entries in the ledger of
travelling expenses, with initials against them, something
&quot;H. B. H.&quot; and something &quot;J. S. L.&quot; It shows
where they are travelling. Those are the travelling expenses for
Mr. Lowden or Mr. harmer.<br>
Cross-examined by Mr. Curtis Bennett. In the ledger there are a
number of entries of stamps purchased without any names. That
would include stamps which were purchased from other people than
Carame. In the cash book there are entries of stamps bought which
correspond with the amounts and dates of payment to Carame, and
in some cases the name of Carame appears in brackets. I used to
draw the cheques to Carame. There was no secrecy at all about
Carame in the office. All his letters were copied into the letter
book. I kept the hill book.<br>
Re-examined. The letters from Carame were kept. Every three
months I cleared the locker out, so that in April, 1908, you
would not find any letters from Carame earlier than January,
1906. They would be put in the store room. Separate letter books
were kept for Mack and Co. There were two. I thought you had
them. I do not think you will find any letters copied in any of
the letter books to Carame. They may have got into them in
mistake. I do not remember if I wrote any letters before
February, 1909, to Carame for the West End Stamp Company. I might
have done in February. This is one of them. I do not know if I
did some for H. Mack and Co. at that time.</p>

<p align="left">Detective-sergeant JOHN THOMAS CURRIE, New
Scotland Yard. I am acquainted with French. I have had placed in
my hands for translation and have translated a number of letters
which are in Exhibit 31, which I found in Carame's office at
Paris and which are in French. The correct translations are in
Exhibit 75. I am also acquainted with German and have been
through part of Exhibit 75, which are correct translations made
by Detective Ward, who is now suffering from pneumonia. I have
also had the letter book of the West End Stamp Company. Exhibit
34 are correct translations of the last five letters addressed to
Carame; 35 consists of the original letters from Carame found at
Lowden's premises; 36 is a correct translation of those. They are
in German.</p>

<p align="left">Inspector STOCKLEY recalled. I did not find any
press copy letter book of Herbert Mack and Co. at 20, Villiers
Street; none has ever been given to me. In the letter books of
the West End Stamp. Company I found six letters to Carame other
than those dated February and March, 1909. (Letters read).<br>
Detective-sergeant CURRIE recalled. I have not translated the
letter dated June 9, 1908. I have the original in French. (Letter
read).</p>

(Defence.)</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">JOHN STEWART LOWDEN</font>
(prisoner, on oath). I have been engaged in the stamp trade eight
or nine years. I first became associated with Harmer about the
end of 1906. At that time I was carrying on the West End Stamp
Company. That was an entirely retail business. After it was
converted into a company it did only wholesale business. Herbert
Mack and Co. was formed, I think, in 1907. That was for retail
business. First of all, Herbert Mack and Co. carried on business
at Cheapside. That was an experiment. Then it was transferred to
20, Villiers Street. I did not know Parker before I met Harmer.
Harmer introduced me to Parker. He told me Parker was the man
that had the entire monopoly of the Borneo stamps, and that if
any-one wanted to buy Borneo stamps they had to get them from
him. I think this was the first week I was introduced to Harmer;
that would be a month before Harmer joined me. I began doing
business with Parker about June or July, 1906. We bought the
entire remainder of the Labuan Crown issue for £2,500. The money
for the stamps was always paid to Parker in the offices of the
North Borneo Company. After that we contracted with him to buy
the entire remainder of the Borneo and Labuan stamps that had
been cancelled to order for the purpose of sale to collectors,
for the sum of £10,500, of which something like £7,000 has been
paid to him. We had a distinct guarantee from him that no one
else had ever bought these cancelled stamps of Borneo, that he
was the sole buyer. Some few months ago Mr. Parker was unable to
deliver stamps of the 1894 issue. He suggested he should have the
1887 issue reprinted to make up for the stamps he could not
deliver. The difference between the 1897 and 1894 issues is that
the 1897 has the words put in in Chinese characters. That
contract is still running. I do not understand the French or
German languages. Harmer understands a certain amount of German.
Prior to Christmas of 1907 we had some transactions with a <font
color="#FF0000"><strong>Mr. Dumonteuil</strong></font>, in
France. About Christmas I was in Paris with Mr. Harmer. Monsieur
Gay called upon us and brought with him Rene Carame. Carame spoke
French only. Gay understood a little bit of German, so we managed
to get along; it was rather difficult. Harmer translated it on to
me. Carame said he had heard we had bought this large stock of
Borneo stamps, and as he had the plates of the 1887 issue he
suggested reprinting them for us and selling the lot to us with
the plates at the completion of the printing. The sum was
eventually agreed at £200 for 50,000 sets complete and 50,000
sets of four values. It was common knowledge that certain
Governments sold plates after they had finished with them; in
fact, <strong>I had the plates of one country myself, Venezuela.</strong>
I have also the written authority allowing me to reprint those
stamps. I have still got those plates. I did not get them from
President Castro; it was the revolutionary Government. The
revolutionary Government had a new stamp, and sold them to
dealers straight away. Parker sold to us 100,000 of the 1887
printers' waste; we were not able to get any of the proper ones.
In printing from plates obtained from Governments it is
practically impossible to get the right colour; you may get it in
a few sheets correct. At the first interview with Carame it was
settled we should buy subject to the proofs being correct; he
subsequently sent the proofs along and we concluded the deal. We
had to give Carame instructions as to colour, size, perforation,
etc. If he had taken the 10c. blue and printed it in red it would
have been no use to me. We have to have continual proofs until we
find they are correct. Harmer severed his connection with me in
October last. I was anxious to continue the retail business as I
knew more about that. Harmer is entirely wholesale; he does not
understand retail business. That was the reason we separated. The
reason of the bills given to Carame appearing in the name of Gay
was this: Gay was a stamp dealer and bill discounter; the bills
were given to him to discount, and as the bills were not made out
to any special name we thought Mr. Gay would sign these bills.
Miss Neumann would be given instructions to enter them up in the
bill book. The bills themselves were kept. The price Mr. Ackland
paid, 25s. to 33s. per 100 sets, was the price of reprints. The
genuine stamps cannot be bought under 80s. per 100 sets. <strong>I
had not the slightest idea we were selling forged stamps. </strong>The
stamps printed and cancelled by the North Borneo Company I should
call genuine. Every word in the statutory declaration is true.
Carame never suggested that the stamps he was supplying us with
were facsimiles.<br>
Cross-examined. I did not carry on business as H. Mack and Co.
before I met Harmer; it was started a year after Harmer met me. I
do not think I ever signed letters; they were stamped generally.
I do not produce the letter book of H. Mack and Co.; I have not
been asked to do so. I have not been asked to look for the
letters from Carame. I cannot tell you whether when I bought the
right to reproduce Venezuela stamps I bought the right to
reproduce stamps then current. I think you will find it in
Gibbons' book. I did not know at the time that in November, 1907,
the 1887 issue of &quot;Borneo&quot; were available for postage
and revenue purposes. I thought they were demonetised immediately
they were out of print. I bought some £400 worth of this issue
from a man who had taken them to the North Borneo Company to buy
back. They said, &quot;No, you have got the stamps and we have
got the money.&quot; They would not pay for them. I asked Parker
about it; he always understood they were demonetised. I was
naturally anxious that Carame should imitate the original stamps
as near as possible. For that purpose we purchased the paper and
sent it out to him. We were rather under the impression that
Carame had bought the plates from a dealer, and we had the
particular dealer in our mind. He has got hold of one or two
things like that, and probably would not like his name mentioned.
I did not deal with the matter of the perforation; that was done
by Mr. Harmer. It never crossed our minds to go to Messrs. Blades
to get them perforated. We should not expect to pay other people
for doing it. Carame did not get it right, and we sent the
perforator along and told him to put it right. We did not get
Carame to perforate any of the stamps we got from Parker. It is
customary to return their money if customers complain. Mr.
Ackland told me he had had some of the Carame stamps returned as
forgeries. He also said he had taken them to Gibbons, who said
they were reprints. I told him I knew they were genuine reprints
and I knew the man who had the plates. I did not tell him to send
them out without comment. It is absolutely untrue. I cannot say
if there is any reference in any letter to Carame having the
original plates. The prices ought to have told the buyers that
they were reprints. A collector. does not expect to get 4s. 4d.
worth for 9d. and expect to get originals.</p>

<p align="left">HENRY REVELL HARMER (prisoner, on oath). I have
been in the stamp trade some 11 years. Before I joined Lowden I
carried on business in partnership as Boulton and Co. in Queen
Street, Cheapside. <strong>While I was with that firm they
acquired the plate of the Venezuela stamps for £300.</strong> My
interest in that firm was transferred to the West End Stamp
Company. Since October last I have had no interest in the West
End Stamp Company other than the shares that remained in my name.
After that company was formed we started the firm of Mack and Co.
for the purpose of dealing with retail business. I had no voice
in the management of it. My business took me on the Continent
about five months out of 12. Before I joined Lowden I had known
Parker many years. I purchased North Borneo stamps from him. He
always said he was the only person that was able to obtain the
cancelled to order stamps of Borneo from the company. It was
common knowledge in the trade. Parker came to Villiers Street to
do business, and I introduced him to Lowden. I told Lowden then
or previously that Parker was well known as the only person able
to obtain those stamps. After that introduction we purchased from
Parker the Labuan stamps for £2,500. We entered into a contract
with him to buy North Borneo stamps at the rate of £200 worth a
month. In pursuance of that agreement, we received from him a
quantity of unperforated stamps of the 1887 issue. They are known
as printer's waste. Apart from those, we were never able to
obtain from him any stamps of the 1887 issue. He sold the last
lot of the 1887 issue, if I remember rightly, about 10 years ago
to Caiman, a wholesale dealer in New York, and my recollection is
that I bought the last lot from Caiman, amounting to 3,000 or
4,000 sets, in the first year or two that I joined Boulton. It
was common knowledge in the trade that there had been various
issues since then by the North Borneo Company. Parker supplied us
with reprinted stamps of subsequent issues to 1887. When I was in
Paris with Lowden towards the end of 1907 we had a call from M.
Gay and this Rene Carame. I knew Gay before; he is a stamp
dealer. I did not know Carame. I had a conversation with Gay, Gay
translated it to Carame and back again. Carame said he was the
printer of the 1904 issue of Haiti stamps, which had been sold by
<strong>Mons. Dumonteuil</strong>. He also said he had printed
some Somali Coast stamps. He produced what I should say were
printer's proofs of other issues of Haiti, which made it look
extremely probable that the man had got the entree to somebody
who was able to get the Haiti plates, and we had no reason to
doubt him. He also said, &quot;I am able to get,&quot; or &quot;I
have,&quot; &quot;the plates of the 1887 issue of Borneo.&quot;
He asked a fairly long price for them, and ultimately we agreed
the price of 5,000 fr., which was sub-ject to us sending the
paper over. I think we were to have 100,000 sets. The plates were
to be handed to us when the last payment was made. I believed he
had the plates of the 1887 issue at that time. Some difficulties
were experienced with regard to colour and perforation.
Correspondence passed about these matters, and I went over once
or twice. The stamps Parker supplied ranged from 1/2 cent to 10
dollars, and included a 25 dollar fiscal stamp. The stamps Carame
had were from 1/2 cent to 10 cent only. It is important that
reprints should be as near the original as possible. In the eyes
of the collector a reprint is a substitute for the original.
There are many works known to collectors dealing with reprints
only. I never represented that the stamps I was receiving from
Carame were originals. I did not sell them at the price of
originals. The price I sold to Mr. Brown at was exactly a penny a
set. Bright and Sons were selling this set at 7 1/2 d., but they
were originals. When Lowden and I parted he continued the
contract with Parker. When I was arrested at Southend I had a
quantity of North Borneo stamps of my own as well as others, over
two millions. I had none of the Carame stamps, although Inspector
Stockley swore I had. Nearly all of them were returned to me
during the police court proceedings. All he took from me were
genuine. Lowden and I parted on quite friendly terms. I have not
taken part in the business since. I would not have entered into
this contract with Carame if I had not believed he had the
original plates. M. Gay is a respectable dealer. It was known
that we had acquired a practical monopoly from Parker. We
advertised it somewhat, having spent £10,000 on them.<br>
Cross-examined. When I left the company I sold £500 Debentures
which stood in my wife's name to Mr. Lowden, and he was going to
find me a customer for the others. The company was not in
financial difficulties; it could pay its debts. I had no debts.
The reason I did not settle Puttick and Simpson's account was
that there was a dispute as to the actual amount due. I think the
difference was £10 to £20. I continued to deal with Carame on
my own account. He told me he could obtain a plate of a Transvaal
stamp, and he was getting it from a Mr. Duveen who was, I think,
last PostmasterGeneral to the Boer Republic. I did not deal with
Carame in Borneo stamps. He was to submit me proofs of the
Transvaal stamps and, subject to the price being agreed, I was
going to buy them, but they were never submitted. I should have
sold them as reprints. I should not sell a reprint as an
original. Whether it would be a fraud to do so would depend on
the price. I do not think I supplied anybody with 1887 issue
after I left Lowden. I did not supply any to Muller and Co. Their
postcard is before I left the company. They wrote to my private
address, because they knew I saw them on behalf of the company.
It is customary in Germany to write to the individual and not the
firm. When I left the company, I did not take any of their stock
with me. I bought from them some Borneo stamps, but none of the
1887 issue. Lowden preferred to keep them in his own hands. It
did not occur to me when Carame said he had got, or could get,
the Borneo plates that he might manufacture plates&#151;quite the
reverse. I knew that the Haiti stamps were at that time printed
in Paris for the Haiti Government, and thought he had probably
got the plates from the printer. As to inquiring where he got the
Borneo plates from, I do not care to ask a man his private
business. This was two months after our contract with Parker. It
would be honest to mix reprints in packets and sell them if they
were good value for money. There would be no objection to the
customer knowing they were reprints. I do not sell packets of
stamps. I buy from sample and my customers buy from sample. There
was no reason why all the world should not know they were
reprints. I should not like them to think I was having them
reprinted in large quantities. There is a huge difference between
a reprint of 1894 and a genuine stamp reprinted a few years
before that. You cannot make two printings identically the same.
I was not trying to get them identically the same as the genuine
original stamps. They should be as near as possible; not to pass
for genuine originals. I have a dim recollection of selling Mr.
Brown some stamps when I was at Salisbury. I sold them from the
sample in my book. When he complained that he had heard that they
were forgeries, and I replied that they were undoubtedly right,
that they existed in a number of shades and large quantities must
have been printed, I wanted him to understand they were from the
original plates. It was not my business to tell him they were
reprinted. I had left the West End Stamp Company, and I did not
think it was right that I should tell him that Lowden had the
plates or was likely to get them. If you like to put it, it was
loyalty to a late partner. It was loyalty that made me suggest
that he should have his money back; that he should apply to the
West End Stamp Company. It was the proper thing to do. The
printer's waste we got from Parker was never perforated. I think
Carame suggested they should be perforated, as there was an
excess of values that we did not want so many of unperforated.
Presumably they were going to be sold as genuine, having come
from Parker. I never sold the Carame stamps at 9d. a set; that
was the Mack price. I only sell stamps wholesale. I sell them at
26s. a hundred sets about. </p>

<h1 align="center">The 1 Pound stamp forgery case (1913)</h1>

<p align="left">In the Daily Telegraph of 11 October 1913 the
following text can be found:<br>
&quot;<em>George Lowden 33, stamp dealer, was indicated for
selling and exposing for sale forged stamps. Mr Bodkin and Mr
Roland Oliver prosecuted; Mr Curtis Bennett and Mr Eustance
Fulton defended. Prisoner carried on business as a stamp deler in
Leicester Square, and the prosecution alleged against him that he
sold between two and three thousand used £1 stamps to a Mr. Lek,
for £810. These the prosecution submitted, were reproductions of
some genuine £1 stamps which Lowden had received from Mr Lek,
and it was said an imperfection in the genuine stamps was also
noticable in some of the alleged forgeries. Lowdens defence was
that he acted as an agent for another man in the sale of the
stamps and had no knowledge that they were forged. The jury found
the prisoner guilty. Detective - inspector Carlin said that in
1903 prisoner, in the name of Moore, gave evidence against a
number of men who were charged with stealing and receiving
stamps. The jury, in returning a verdict in that case, expressed
the opinion that Moore ought also to be in the dock. In 1909
Lowden was tried at this court on a charge similar to that for
which he was now charged, but on that occasion he was acquitted.
The police had received many complaints with regards to him, one
even during the time he had been on bail awaiting trial. Mr
Bodkin said on the accused premises were found two stamps or
punches for making the finishing Windsor postmark. They were
similar to those used in the Royal Household. The Common Sergeant
passed sentence of three years penal servitude.</em>&quot;</p>

<p align="left">Note: The said court case of 1903 can be found at
http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?path=sessionsPapers%2F19030908.xml.
The case deals with stolen mint Government Parcels stamps by
Alfred Waterhouse, a temporary accountant clerk in the Admiralty
Works Department. Lowden bought the stamps from the accused. </p>

<p align="left">In 'The London Philatelist' Vol XXII 1913, page
117 (continued on page 187), the following text can be found: <br>
<em>ALLEGED FORGED ONE POUND STAMPS OF KING EDWARD VII.<br>
A very important case bearing upon Philately in various ways is
now sub judice. George Lowden, trading as George Ellis, stamp
dealer, Leicester Square, was, at Bow Street, before Sir Henry
Curtis Bennett, recently charged, on remand, with obtaining £830
by false pretences from\par Mr. Jonas Lex, a diamond broker, of
Holland Park Gardens, it being alleged that the money was paid
for a number of King Edward VII £1 stamps which proved to be
counterfeit. Mr. Harry Wilson, who appeared for the prosecution,
stated that charges under the Stamp Act would be preferred
against the prisoner.<br>
Mr. Alexander Scott Roberts, of Somerset House, deposed that the
watermarks in the alleged forged stamps were produced by a
totally different process from those in genuine stamps. The
difference between the two was chiefly noticeable by the crown
and the hair on the King's head. In reply to Mr. Harry Myers, who
defended, witness said used £1 stamps were somewhat rare, and he
believed a well-known firm of dealers sold them at 18s. each.
These forgeries were fairly good imitations, but he could not
understand an experienced dealer being deceived by them.<br>
Mr. Lex, giving evidence in support of the opening statement
already reported, said he agreed to buy 2683 used £1 stamps at
7s.9d. each, and prisoner assured him they were genuine. When he
discovered that the stamps were spurious he told prisoner that he
expected to get his money back.<br>
In cross-examination, prosecutor said he was not a stamp dealer,
and had never sold any stamps. He had been collecting for about
twelve months. He did not know whether prisoner had seen the
stamps in question until the parcel containing them was opened in
the presence of witness and another gentleman. Prisoner was again
remanded on the same bail as before.<br>
We refrain from comment for obvious reasons, but cannot accept
prosecutor's evidence as to his status. We never yet heard of a
&quot;young collector&quot; of &quot;twelve months'
experience&quot; who required 2683 stamps all alike!<br>
</em>Page 187:<em><br>
THE FORGED ONE POUND STAMP OF GREAT BRITAIN<br>
The further proceedings in this case, referred to on page 117,
were taken on July 24, when, as reported by the Daily Telegraph:<br>
&quot;George Lowden, stamp dealer, was indicted for having in his
possession and selling 2679 forged stamps. Mr. Bodkin and Mr.
Roland Oliver prosecuted ; Mr. Curtis Bennett defended. <br>
&quot;According to the case for the prosecution, the defendant,
as a stamp dealer, sold to Mr. Jonas Lek, a diamond merchant, a
parcel of 2679 cancelled £1 stamps for £830, all bearing the
Jersey postmark. Both the stamps and the postmarks were found to
be forgeries. Prisoner said that he was only acting as
intermediary for another man, who, with the exception of Lowden's
commission, had the whole of the money. He had not the slightest
idea, he said, that the stamps were forgeries. After consulting
in private for over an hour, the jury disagreed. The Recorder
accordingly discharged the jury, and ordered that the case should
be retried next session. Defendant was released on bail.&quot;<br>
The result is eminently unsatisfactory to every one concerned,
and it is to be hoped that further evidence may be obtained,
either by the prosecution or the defence, so as to enable the
next jury to pronounce a decision.<br>
</em>On page 237 the story continues, but the story is basically
identical to the one shown above in the Daily Telegraph of 11
October 1913. </p>
