<h2 align="left"><a href="fournier1.htm">Fournier</a> forgeries</h2>

<p align="left">The following forgeries are of the small ship
design, I never saw <a href="fournier1.htm">Fournier</a>
forgeries of the larger sized stamps (1 M to 5 M).</p>

<p align="left">The above stamps are <a href="fournier1.htm">Fournier</a>
forgeries, however, they are not listed in the Fournier pricelist
of 1914. These imperforated stamps are probably taken from a
'Fournier Album'. After Fournier died, albums with his forgeries
were sold to warn collectors against these forgeries. These
stamps were of course sold by Fournier with perforation and
without the 'FAUX' (=forgery in french) overprint. Note that the
'S' of 'KIAUTSCHOU' is strange in the above two stamps and that
the word 'KIAUTSCHOU' is too curved too fit exactly in the label.</p>

<p align="left">Fournier seems to have printed these forgeries in
sheets containing one value of each colony, examples of
(unfinished) sheets:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa2/gcolfournier2.jpg"> <img

src="germa5/germcolsforgs2001.jpg" border="0" width="946"
height="833"></a></p>

<p align="left">In the top row were printed: 'Deutsch
Südwestafrika, Kiautschou, (pfennig value), Deutsch-Neu-Guinea
and Kiautschou (cents value). In the middle row Kamerun,
Marianen, Samoa and Deutsch-Ostafika (value in pesa). Finally in
the bottom row Karolinen, Marshall-Inseln, Togo and
Deutsch-Ostafrika (value in heller). I have also seen similar
sheets for the values: 3 p (or the corresponding value in cents
of Kiautschau, in pesa or heller for German East Africa), 10 p,
20 p, 25 p (with blanks for the unissued cents value of
Kiautschau and the pesa value of German East Africa), 40 p, 50 p
(with blanks for cents value of Kiautschau and the heller value
of German East Africa) and 80 p. <br>
I have also seen a similar sheet with 12 stamps of the 45 h value
of German East Africa. I presume this sheet was also produced by
Fournier. </p>

<p align="left">Genuine proofs in the value 2 p grey apparently
also exist with different colony names printed side by side (see
the Friedemann book). </p>

<h2 align="left">USA forgeries:</h2>

<p align="left">In the 1970 photo-lithographed stamps appeared in
the USA, purporting to be stamps of the German colonies. The
stamps can be easily recognised by their general dull and flat
appearance. The colours are weak and the shading is often solid
colour. The paper is unwatermarked and somewhat coarse. It is
less stiff than that of original stamps. The forged stamps are
perforated 13 (genuine stamps have perforation 14). Most of these
forgeries are uncancelled, but some bear falsified postmarks as
well (information Dirk Spennemann). Probably all small ship
stamps of all colonies were forged. Examples of these forgeries:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="germa5/carolforgs1.jpg"><img

Most likely USA forgeries.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="germa2/togoforgs1.jpg"><img
src="germa2/togoforgs1.jpg" border="0" width="443" height="292"></a></p>

<p align="left">I think the above forgeries are also USA
forgeries, they have a very strange cancel: 'KETE KRATS.....'. I
have also seen the values 10 p red and 20 p blue of Togo with
exactly the same cancel.</p>

<h2 align="left">Forged British overprints (<a href="hialeah.htm">Hialeah</a>
forgeries):</h2>

<p align="left">The provisional overprints of the German Colonies
by Great Britain have been extensively forged.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa/samoafor1.jpg" alt="Forgery!"
width="441" height="250"><br>
(Forged overprint)</p>

<p align="left">From late 1999 onwards genuine stamps and forged
overprints imposed on genuine stamps were offered on the on-line
auction-house <b>e-bay</b> by the Florida-based seller <b>cclan.</b>
Since then large numbers of additional overprints covering wide
aspects of philatelic collection fields have been offered by <b>'cclan'</b>
and later by sellers calling themselves <b>'adtinvest,' 'futete,'</b>
and <b>'unlimitedstamps'</b>. All are/were based in Hialeah in
Florida (USA). By late 2000 these sellers also offered stamps on <b>Yahoo
Auctions</b>. Beginning in May 2000 a large number of forged <b>G.R.I.</b>
overprints of German colonial stamps from Samoa, the Marshall
Islands and German New Guinea were offered for sale on the
on-line auction house <b>e-bay</b> (information Dirk Spennemann).
I've seen inverted and double overprints. The forgers also
invented fake forger names to sell there merchandise. I have the
impression that the seller atdinvest is printing its own stamps
recently (normally in imperforate sheets with fancy overprints of
too many countries to name here). For more information on Hialeah
forgeries <a href="hialeah.htm">click here</a>. Much more on
these forgeries can be found on
http://marshall.csu.edu.au/html/Stamps/Stamps.html, made by Dirk
H.R. Spennemann. Some examples:</p>

<p align="left">The ink seems to leak through the paper in these
forgeries, modern ink is used:</p>

height="309"> <img src="germa2/spenhali2d.jpg" width="263"
height="313"></p>

<p align="left">According to Dirk Spennemann: <em>&quot;Because
hand-held rubber stamps were used to produce these forgeries, the
overprint is fuzzy, and broad, as opposed to crisp and clear. On
the original genuine overprints the letters were set in formes,
with both rows of characters set parallel. As the production of
the Hialeah overprints was done manually, most lcertainly using
seperate rubber stamps for the 'G.R.I.' and the value, this
parallel alignment is not maintained.&quot; </em>The cancelling
dates should also be checked as sometimes impossible dates are
used on these forgeries.</p>

<p align="left">All overprinted Samoa stamps with watermark are
forgeries!</p>

<h1 align="left">Other 'Hialeah products'</h1>

<p align="center"><img src="germa2/atdfor1.jpg" width="600"

(Some Hialeah forgeries, reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">I have recently (August 2003) seen some large
ship stamps of the German colonies (with and without 'GRI'
overprint) made by the Hialeah forger. I have also seen some of
the smaller ship values forged by the Hialeah forger. The
perforation is very bad and the printing not very clear.</p>

<h1 align="center">Private reprints</h1>

<p align="left">I've seen an unofficial imperforate minisheet
with red ship stamps (2 rows of 5 stamps, German East Africa,
Cameroons, Togo, Samoa, Kiautschou, German South West Africa,
Carolines, Marshall Islands, Marianas and German New Guinea),
which was issued in 1963 for the 40th anniversary of the
'Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Sammler Deutscher
Kolonialpostwertzeichen'. At least 1900 sheets were issued (I've
seen sheet 1896). An oblique overprint '50 JAHRE 1923-1973' was
apparently applied on this sheetlet 10 years later. </p>

&quot;BRIEFMARKENSAMMLER-VEREIN EV. SOLINGEN&quot; from 1978: </p>
