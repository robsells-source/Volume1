<p>William B.Hale was a stamp forger from Williamsville,
Massachusetts (USA). According to 'Philatelic forgers, their Work
and Lives' by V.E.Tyler, he mainly forged cancels, although he is
known to have forged the 5 c Mobile confederate stamp. </p>

An advertising label with 1 PESO and the image of William B.Hale
in the center. I've also seen this label with the blue color
changed to black. </p>

<p align="left">There are also some Pan American Exposition
labels with his name printed at the bottom. They appear to have
been printed at the same time as the above labels?:</p>

'United States' stamp with &quot;PAN AMERCICAN EXPOSITION&quot;
and &quot;BUFFALO&quot; and &quot;NIAGARA&quot; in two different
colors.</p>

<p>The cancels he forged are known to be at least some USA
cancels and precancels, Canada, Helgoland and a double circle
Hiogo Japan postmark as well as forged overprints of Panama.</p>

<p>Hale died in 1936 in prison, according to Philatelic Forgers
by V.E.Tyler, a number of forged cancels were then found of
Canada, Helgoland, United States and Hiogo (Japan), and some
overprint forgeries of Panama..</p>

<p>There might be evidence that he was also involved in the next
Newfoundland essays (his name should be written on top of some of
these sheetlets, but I have never seen it personally):</p>

Newfoundland bogus stamps from 1901.</p>

<p align="left">According to the document
https://bnaps.org/studygroups/Newfoundland/newsletters/nfl-1991-08-w036.pdf,
the above labels were introduced as revenue stamps in 1901. But
in 1902 they were confirmed to be bogus issues. Apparently the
name of Alfred Baguet was engraved in the bottom of the 5 c stamp
as &quot;A. BAGUET GR 58 STRASBOURG PARIS&quot; (although I can't
decipher it myself). See Volume 2 of this catalogue for more
information on the stamp forger Baguet. Similar labels of Crete
are also attributed to the same duo. </p>
