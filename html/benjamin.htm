<p>Alfred Benjamin and Julian Hippolite Sarpy (Benjamin and
Sarpy) sold many of <a href="jeffreys.htm">Jeffreys forgeries</a>
in their shop (according to 'Philatelic forgers, their lives and
works' by Varro E. Tyler). Benjamin named his house 'Sydney View
Villa', due to his succesful business in selling the first stamps
of New South Wales.</p>

<p>In 1892 Jefrreys was convicted to six months imprisonment with
hard labour for 'conspiracy to defraud the public' for his stamp
forging activities. For the trial of <a href="jeffreys2.htm">Jeffreys,

<p>In the Philatelic Record of 1891 (December 1891, page 298),
Benjamin complains of forgeries of Bermuda himself (just a few
weeks before he got arrested in December 1891?). Although
according to Tyler he did sell bogus Bermuda overprints to the
famous collector <a href="ferrari.htm">Ferrari</a>:<br>
<em>BERMUDAS STAMPS&#151;A DANGEROUS FORGERY. Sir,&#151;Will you
allow me to warn philatelists and dealers against a most
dangerous forgery, which has been in the London market for some
years, and defies detection from the greatest experts? The stamp
in question is the Bermuda penny rose, watermark CC and crown,
surcharged threepence slanting across the stamp, issued in 1873.
Last year I wrote to a certain firm of large dealers, who
immediately sent me one on approval for 30s. On examining the
stamp I was surprised to see that the surcharge was printed on
the penny rose, but watermarked CA and crown, a stamp that was
not issued till 1884, this being conclusive proof that it is
impossible for it to be a genuine surcharge. I sent the stamp
back at once, and the explanation was that it was sent out in
mistake. May I advise all collectors and dealers to examine these
stamps, to see if they have the right watermark on? If not, they
may be sure that the surcharge is false. Should there be any
doubt on the subject, and the stamps are sent to me, I shall be
pleased to give my opinion. For years past I have made the stamps
of Bermuda my special study. Sydney View Villa, 46, Oval Road,
London, S.W. A. BENJAMIN.</em></p>
