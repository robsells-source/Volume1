Portrait and signature of Upham.</p>

<p align="left">Samuel C. Upham was a forger from Philadelphia
(403 Chestnut St. Philadelphia.).. He only made quite crude
forgeries of the Confederate issues of the USA and some of the
confederate locals. His forgeries are supposed to have been made
in 1862 (so only shortly after the appearance of the genuine
stamps). He also made forgeries of the banknotes of the
confederate states. See also:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_C._Upham. </p>

forgeries:</strong></p>

<p align="left">In the above forgeries made by S.C.Upham, the
background consists of square dots. On early prints, the cheek
has some shading on it (see first image above). They were
produced in sheets of six (see below) and I've seen the colours
light green, dark green, blue, orange and red.</p>

(Upham sheetlets with 6 forgeries)</p>

<p align="left">It seems that mostly his forgeries were printed
in sheets of six. Some of these sheets had the text 'Fac-Simile
Rebel Stamp.-Sold Wholesale and Retail, by S. C. Upham, 403
Chestnut St. Philadelphia.' printed on it. Upham did write after
the war to Lee Haper Author of '<em>The Currency of the
Confederate States of America' </em>printed in&nbsp;1875&nbsp;and
others '<em>I printed in all 28 varieties of facsimile rebel
notes, shinplasters, and fifteen different postage stamps.</em>'and
'<em>&#133;I printed from the 12 of March, 1862 to the 1</em><sup><em>st</em></sup><em>
of August, 1863.</em>' (information obtained thanks to Justin
Poklis).</p>

Sheetlet with 6 Upham forgeries. </p>

<p align="left">In the above Upham forgery, the face is very
crudely made, the background consists of horizontal lines and
there is a small dash to the right of 'OF'. I have also seen this
stamp in red.</p>

(Upham forgery?)</p>

<p align="left">The above stamp is another very crude forgery.
Some sources say that it was made by Upham, however there is
serious doubt about this (information obtained thanks to Justin
Poklis).</p>

<p align="left">I'm not aware of Upham producing any other values
than 5 and 10 c of the Confederate States.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Upham forgeries of the locals of the
Confederate States:</strong></p>

<p align="left">He is believed to have made forgeries of Memphis
(2 c 'Mc Callaway' and 5 c), Mobile (5 c), Nashville (5 c) and
New Orleans (2 c blue, 2 c red, 5 c brown).</p>

(Upham forgery, with zoom-in)</p>

<p align="left">This Upham forgery has the following
distinghuishing characteristics (obtained from Kevin Baker's
site): There is no partial diamond between the 'M' and 'P' of
'MEMPHIS'. The '5' cuts off the top part of two diamonds. There
are two complete diamonds below the 'H' and 'I' of 'MEMPHIS'.</p>

<h4 align="left">Mobile</h4>

Here a full sheet of 6 Upham forgeries. The text at the bottom
reads: &quot;Fac-Simile Rebel Postage Stamp. - Sold Wholesale and
Retail, by S.C.Upham 403 Chestnut St. Philadelphia.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><a href="usa3/mobile10.jpg"><img

href="usa3/mobile12.jpg"><img src="usa3/mobile12.jpg" border="0"
width="200" height="213"></a><br>
The positions in the sheetlet can be determined: The first
forgery is from the upper left (large smudge at the bottom frame
line), the second forgery is from the upper right (break in left
frameline and small smudge in bottom frame line).</p>

Upham forgery of Nashville, apparently differing in the upper
left and lower left scrolls from the genuine stamps. There is
also a double crossbar in the 'A' of 'NASHVILLE' in this forgery.
I've also seen a red Upham forgery. </p>

Sheetlet with 6 New Orleans Upham forgeries. </p>

<p align="left">The above stamps are Upham counterfeits, there is
a big space between the 'O' and the 'S' of 'POST' (see the red
arrows in the picture on the right hand side). The 'S' leans too
far to the right. The left upper ornament is touching the label
with 'J.L. Riddell', in the genuine stamp it doesn't. The
ornament in the lower left corner looks like a hand, it's
therefore called the 'waving hand forgery'. The thin leaf at the
bottom doesn't touch the circle above it. The ornament at the
right upper corner had four small leaves pointing upwards.
Finally, there is no thin arched line between the circle and the
word 'PAID'.</p>

<h4 align="left">Baton Rouge</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/baton2.jpg" width="206"
height="213"></p>

<p align="left">If my information is correct, the above forgery
of Baton Rouge was also made by Upham. </p>

<hr>

<p align="left">Some authors say that Upham is also believed to
be responsable for the 'Blockade' issues made in 1864 (see Varro
Tyler in 'Philatelic Forgers, their Lives and Works'). However,
several forgeries of this fantasy issue exist and it is not even
clear if he was the original 'source' of these stamps. I don't
know if the stamps shown below are made by him or another forger.
According to Justin Poklis, the origin of these forgeries is more
likely to be Europe. Later other forgers, such as Tayler copied
this design. Four different types exist (made by different
forgers); the last type being made in the 1950's in Switzerland
(information obtained from Justin Poklis).</p>

This particular copy was made by the forger Taylor</p>
