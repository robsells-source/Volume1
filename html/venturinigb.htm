<p align="left">A.Venturini was a forger from Italy in the early
1900's. He lived in Pisa, Turin and Florence.</p>

<p align="left">According to &quot;Philatelic Forgers, their
Lives and Works&quot; by V.E.Tyler, he made (or at least sold)
forgeries of Swiss Cantonal stamps, French and French Colonies
postage dues, Spain, Baden (see below), Monaco and Tuscany. He
also sold Spanish and Portuguese colonies forgeries. If anyone
has more information, please contact me! Also, according to the
same source, he might have obtained his forgeries from <a
href="oneglia1.htm">Oneglia</a>. </p>

I presume these forgeries of Baden were made by Venturini. The
stamp forger <a href="fournier1.htm">Fournier</a> applied the
perforations and cancels and sold them afterwards. </p>

An imperforate 30 k stamp of Baden? Possibly a Venturini forgery.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Concerning the Venturini forgeries of Baden,
the following text can be found in the Philatelic Journal of
Great Britain, May 25, 1901, page 90 (it turns out that Venturini
not only sold forgeries of the 18 k and 30 k, but even the
printing plates): :</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>A Forgery Monger. </em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>From The Schweizer Briefmarken Zeitung</em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>One of the most noted forgers of the old
Italian stamps is P. Oneglia, of Turin. Following the movement of
his heart, this noble philanthropist took up the manufacture of
stamps and now manufactures to his heart's content everything in
the way of stamps, perforated and unperforated, used and unused,
half sheets, whole sheets, in short all that the philatelic heart
could wish for. So that everyone, even the smallest collector can
obtain without any cost worth mentioning, the greatest rarities,
the firm &#147; Oneglia &#148; will send a price-list free to
anyone. Wonderful news reaches, us also from Pisa. In this town
with the crooked tower, a. gentleman lives named </em><em><strong>A.
Venturini</strong></em><em> ; after long experience Herr
Venturini has come to the conclusion that the trade in
&#147;Imitations&#148; pays much better than that in real stamps.
Secretly, this man obtained a &#147; Lot &#148; of Imitations,
and as he is of a very unselfish nature, he wishes the
&#147;reproductions&#148; (as he very prettily names them) to be
within the reach of everybody. &quot;With this object the good </em><em><strong>Venturini</strong></em><em>
offers his imitations to all dealers, adding that &#147;in Italy
it is not forbidden to manufacture stamp reproductions.&#148;</em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>He made this offer to one of our first
German dealers and enclosed a specimen of his Imitations. </em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>In an article in miserable French he
says,- &#147;You will be convinced that you can sell to
collectors that set of France aud Colonies for 10 Mk. and the
others for 5-7 50 Mk. whilst you do not pay so much as for the
originals.&#148;</em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>We give some of the prices of these
Reproductions. The </em><em><strong>Zurich</strong></em><em> 6r.
are used or unused 20 for 60 Mk. </em><em><strong><u>Baden</u></strong></em><em><u>
18kr. green used 30 for 2 Mk</u></em><em>. The price of the
stumps offered amounts to 135 Mk. but for the whole
&#147;Lot&#148; only 1,000- Mk. and even 600 Mk. in money and the
rest in &#147;genuine rarities.&#148; &#147;For the 10 Metal
stereotypes &#146;&#146;says </em><em><strong>Venturini</strong></em><em>,
&#147;which have served for printing, my lowest price is 20Mk.
each, or 200 Mk. for the 10.&quot; And now we come to the end of
this wonderful letter which runs &#147;You can fully rely on my
discretion about this business.&quot; \Vhat a character ! In the
reply the dealer must have given Venturini a dubbing, for the
second letter begins with : &#147;I must say that your letter
does not please me at all &#148; etc., and Venturini goes on to
explain the difference between &#147; Selling imitations as sucli
or selling theft, as genuine.&#148; But Venturini is a good
fellow and does not resent anything, and so that the dealer may
still have the reproductions he writes :&#151;&#147;After all I
will let you have them all and the Stereotypes. If you will have
the stamps, I must send them to Turin to be perforated and you
will have to wait a week.&#148; And then he puts the whole of it
down to 350 Mk. More can surely not be done! Venturini then sends
his stamps to Turin and and to no other than his bosom friend </em><em><strong>Oneglia</strong></em><em>.</em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>The real collector would treat these
stamps with horror and rather leave his album empty than fill it
with that kind of imitation which offends the eye of any proper
collector. To war with these forgers !</em></p>

These are genuine Suez Canal stamps, with forged &quot;5105&quot;
and &quot;5129&quot; numeral cancels added by Oneglia and
subsequently sold by the stamp forger Venturini. </p>

Forgeries of the postage due stamps of France and its colonies.
These might be the Venturini forgeries that are shown in
Vertraulichen Mitteilungen.On the left stamp of the above pair,
the &quot;2&quot; is placed too far to the right.</p>
