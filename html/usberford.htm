<p align="left">At least one type of forgeries exists of the 3 c
and 25 c made by <a href="casey.htm">Casey</a> (described in the
Lyon's book as forgery A). He offered them as reprints. The full
story about Casey's 'reprints' can be found in 'Philatelic
Forgers, their Lives and Works' by V.E.Tyler. After discovering
the truth and being exposed by <a href="taylor.htm">S.Allan
Taylor</a>, Casey was removed from his editorship of 'The
American Journal of Philately' by the publisher, <a
href="scott.htm">J.W.Scott</a>. It is amusing that both Taylor
and Scott are also listed in V.E.Tyler's book on philatelic
forgers..... The following text can be found in 'The United
States Locals' book by Coster on this matter: <br>
&quot;<em>One original set of the Berford stamps is said to
exist, in the collection of an individual who, perhaps,
appreciating their rarity and desiring that the semblance of the
reality should be within the reach of all, caused
photo-lithographic &quot; reproductions &quot; to be made a
couple of years ago. These imitations (or &quot;reprints&quot; as
they were called by the individual already referred to) have been
fully ventilated in the columns of the Philatelic press.</em>&quot;</p>

<p align="left">In The Philatelic Journal by E.L.Pemberton of
January 20, 1875 the following text can be found:<br>
<em>Berford's Express.&#151;This is the name of one of the very
oldest American Express Companies which issued stamps. A
description of one appears in 1865 in the following terms in the
S. CM. : &quot; Large 10 in centre, to California printed over
it, Bedford &amp; co.'s express above, n° 2 astor house, n. y.
below, with glory around.&quot; Bedford is an evident misprint
for Berford. <br>
From that day till about a year ago no further information was
elicited concerning it, but </em><a href="casey.htm"><em>Mr. J.
J. Casey</em></a><em>, a.m., then editor of The American Journal
of Philately, stated in his own paper that he had
&quot;found&quot; a number in Mr. Berford's Scrapbook, and that
he had obtained possession of them ; then, with the untiring
energy of a true Philatelist, he &quot;found the original stones
&quot; of the Berford stamps, and straightway offered &quot;
reprints &quot; of four values right and left. The hard part of
this anecdote is, that Mr. J. J. Casey, a.m., took the designs of
these reprints to the New York Graphic Company, and they &quot;
found the stones &quot; for him ! And it appears that no original
stones exist, and it seems the Graphic Company executed a certain
number from the stones prepared by them, and then, in a
methodical and business-like manner, &quot;cleaned&quot; the
design off. No one would have known all this but for the kind
consideration of </em><a href="taylor.htm"><em>Mr. S. Allan
Taylor</em></a><em>, who thus explains himself in a letter to The
Stamp Collector's Magazine for last December :<br>
&quot;When I saw the price lists of European dealers teeming with
these abominations, I thought it was worth my while to look up
the matter. No matter if I was a notorious swindler, and chief of
a ring of counterfeiters, et al, I was never accused of being a
fool, or of being readily imposed upon. So I went to work on the
Berford subject, and after a tedious and laborious investigation,
occupying and extending over a period of two months, I at last
discovered that the Berford locals were executed by the New York
Graphic Company from designs brought to them, and not from the
original stones, for none such exist.&quot;<br>
Mr. Coster also has something to say ; for when this bubble
burst, he naturally wanted Mr. J. J. Casey to refund the cash
received by him for certain large lots sold to Mr. Coster. Then
the lively Casey says he sold them &quot;as a practical joke of
the highest kind ! &quot; Gratifying to Coster, and rather warm
for Casey. It appears that our wellbeloved Allan Taylor had about
the best of it. Let brotherly love continue.</em></p>

width="576" height="509"><br>
Photolithographed forgeries made by <a href="casey.htm">Casey</a>
of the values 6 c and 25 c. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/usberCaseyforgery.jpg"
width="633" height="670"><br>
3 c Casey forgery, block of six. The top part of the ornamental
border always seems damaged. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="usa3/berfordfor3001.jpg"><img
src="usa3/berfordfor3001.jpg" border="0" width="931"
height="1030"></a><br>
Sheetlet with forged 10 c values in brown color. The top of the
&quot;R&quot; of &quot;CALIFORNIA&quot; is always damaged (made
by Casey?). </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Forgeries in the wrong colour:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="usa/berffor1.jpg"><img
src="usa/berffor1.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="236"></a> <a
href="usa3/berford6.jpg"><img src="usa3/berford6.jpg" border="0"
width="284" height="247"></a> <a href="usa3/berfordTaylor3.jpg"><img
src="usa3/berfordTaylor3.jpg" border="0" width="303" height="259"></a><br>
3 c in red and black! I've also seen this forgery in green. The
&quot;R&quot; of &quot;ASTOR&quot; has a very short tail. The
&quot;Y&quot; of &quot;NY&quot; is too close to the
&quot;A&quot;. It might have been made by the stamp forger
Taylor. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/berfordasis1.jpg" width="325"
height="268"> <br>
Highly dubious 6 c green stamp.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/us11l_1.jpg" width="338"
height="280"> <br>
Very dubious item</p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/Berford3001.jpg" width="292"
height="270"> <img src="usa3/Berford3002.jpg" width="307"
height="266"> <img src="usa/us11l4.jpg" width="300" height="267"><br>
Another set of forgeries (Scott?). In the 25 c, the &quot;U&quot;
of &quot;HOUSE&quot; is connected to the ellipse. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="usa3/usberford4020.jpg"><img
src="usa3/usberford4020.jpg" border="0" width="296" height="274"></a><br>
Different forgery with the &quot;O&quot; of &quot;HOUSE&quot; too
big (another Scott forgery?)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/usberford1.jpg" width="318"
height="275"> <img src="usa3/usberfordasis1.jpg" width="316"
height="286"><br>
Most likely Scott forgeries in black color. In my opinion, in the
3 c, the outer white circle has ink in it on top and on the left.
</p>

<p align="center"><a href="usa3/berford1.jpg"><img
src="usa3/berford1.jpg" border="0" width="324" height="276"></a> <img
src="usa/berford3.jpg" width="297" height="271"><br>
Forgeries of the 6 c value with a lot of smudging around the
lettering. </p>
