<h4>Fournier forgeries of the <a href="gstabad3.htm">Baden 1862
issue</a> (for <a href="badenfor2.htm">other forgeries click here</a>):</h4>

All values (except the 18 kr) have a different upper left design
(the lower right of this squarish design connects to the
framelines around it with a white line).</p>

Fournier forgery of the 6 k with a different perforation. The
cancel '79' is also forged.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/badenfor10Oppenau.jpg"><img

Here the same 6 k forgery but with a &quot;OPPENAU 10 AUG&quot;
cancel which does not appear in the Fournier Album. </p>

<p align="left">Fournier has made forgeries of these stamps, they
have a different perforation (as far as I have seen). The Serrane
Guide mentions that they were made with the help of the engraver
V. (<a href="venturinigb.htm">Venturini</a>?) from Turin (see
comments on Venturini later). All values (except the 18 kr) have
a different upper left design (the lower right of this squarish
design connects to the framelines around it). I've seen all
values of this serie forged by Fournier. In the Fournier album of
philatelic forgeries, the above cancel is given (&quot;79&quot;
in 5 concentric circles) as well as &quot;60&quot; in 5
concentric circles, &quot;8&quot; in 5 concentric circles (see
example below), &quot;31&quot; in 3 concentric circles, 3
concentric circles and a dot in the middle, an &quot;8&quot; in a
small circle, three circular cancels with &quot;KEHL 2 NOV 6-7
N&quot;, &quot;RASTATT 14 OCT 5-10 V&quot; and &quot;FURSTENBERG
17 2 MBG&quot;. I have furthermore seen &quot;KARLSRUHE 2
Mrz&quot; in two straight lines. The cancel &quot;109&quot; in 5
concentric lines is listed under Bavaria in the Fournier album,
however I have seen this cancel on Baden (see below for
examples). Apparently, the cancel &quot;12&quot; in 5 concentric
lines, which was also listed there, can also be found on these
Baden forgeries (see example on the 3 k forgery below).</p>

<p align="left">All values (except 18 kr) can be distinguished by
a break at the bottom right of the upper left hand ornament.</p>

<p align="left">The 18 kreuzer's main distinguishing
characteristic is its perforation. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat2/badefour4.jpg" width="687"

The Fournier forged cancels as they can be found in 'The Fournier
Album of Philatelic Forgeries'. Another cancel &quot;KARLSRUHE 2
Mrz&quot; and date in two straight lines can also be found in
this album. These forged cancels were according to the Serrane
Guide also used on genuine postage due stamps, genuine stamps and
forged postal stationary. I've also seen a cancel
&quot;HEIDELBERG - BASEL 26 OCT 68 ?7&quot; in a Fournier Album.</p>

<p align="left">On
http://www.stampsx.com/ratgeber/stempelliste-falsch.php a forged
&quot;79&quot; Lahr cancel can be seen applied to a 6 kr Thurn
and Taxis stamp. It might be a Fournier product. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Concerning the Venturini forgeries of Baden,
the following text can be found in the Philatelic Journal of
Great Britain, May 25, 1901, page 90 (it turns out that <a
href="venturinigb.htm">Venturini</a> not only sold forgeries of
the 18 k and 30 k, but even the printing plates): :</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>A Forgery Monger. </em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>From The Schweizer Briefmarken Zeitung</em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>One of the most noted forgers of the old
Italian stamps is P. </em><a href="oneglia1.htm"><strong>Oneglia</strong></a><em>,
of Turin. Following the movement of his heart, this noble
philanthropist took up the manufacture of stamps and now
manufactures to his heart's content everything in the way of
stamps, perforated and unperforated, used and unused, half
sheets, whole sheets, in short all that the philatelic heart
could wish for. So that everyone, even the smallest collector can
obtain without any cost worth mentioning, the greatest rarities,
the firm &#147; Oneglia &#148; will send a price-list free to
anyone. Wonderful news reaches, us also from Pisa. In this town
with the crooked tower, a. gentleman lives named </em><em><strong>A.
Venturini</strong></em><em> ; after long experience Herr
Venturini has come to the conclusion that the trade in
&#147;Imitations&#148; pays much better than that in real stamps.
Secretly, this man obtained a &#147; Lot &#148; of Imitations,
and as he is of a very unselfish nature, he wishes the
&#147;reproductions&#148; (as he very prettily names them) to be
within the reach of everybody. &quot;With this object the good </em><em><strong>Venturini</strong></em><em>
offers his imitations to all dealers, adding that &#147;in Italy
it is not forbidden to manufacture stamp reproductions.&#148;</em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>He made this offer to one of our first
German dealers and enclosed a specimen of his Imitations. </em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>In an article in miserable French he
says,- &#147;You will be convinced that you can sell to
collectors that set of France aud Colonies for 10 Mk. and the
others for 5-7 50 Mk. whilst you do not pay so much as for the
originals.&#148;</em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>We give some of the prices of these
Reproductions. The </em><em><strong>Zurich</strong></em><em> 6r.
are used or unused 20 for 60 Mk. </em><em><strong><u>Baden</u></strong></em><em><u>
18kr. green used 30 for 2 Mk</u></em><em>. The price of the
stumps offered amounts to 135 Mk. but for the whole
&#147;Lot&#148; only 1,000- Mk. and even 600 Mk. in money and the
rest in &#147;genuine rarities.&#148; &#147;For the 10 Metal
stereotypes &#146;&#146;says </em><em><strong>Venturini</strong></em><em>,
&#147;which have served for printing, my lowest price is 20Mk.
each, or 200 Mk. for the 10.&quot; And now we come to the end of
this wonderful letter which runs &#147;You can fully rely on my
discretion about this business.&quot; \Vhat a character ! In the
reply the dealer must have given Venturini a dubbing, for the
second letter begins with : &#147;I must say that your letter
does not please me at all &#148; etc., and Venturini goes on to
explain the difference between &#147; Selling imitations as sucli
or selling theft, as genuine.&#148; But Venturini is a good
fellow and does not resent anything, and so that the dealer may
still have the reproductions he writes :&#151;&#147;After all I
will let you have them all and the Stereotypes. If you will have
the stamps, I must send them to Turin to be perforated and you
will have to wait a week.&#148; And then he puts the whole of it
down to 350 Mk. More can surely not be done! Venturini then sends
his stamps to Turin and and to no other than his bosom friend </em><a
href="oneglia1.htm"><strong>Oneglia</strong></a><em>.</em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>The real collector would treat these
stamps with horror and rather leave his album empty than fill it
with that kind of imitation which offends the eye of any proper
collector. To war with these forgers !</em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="oneglia1.htm">Oneglia</a> offers
these forgeries in his 1906 pricelist of &quot;IMITATIONS&quot;
for Fr. 1.50 for the 18 kr and Fr. 1 for the 30 kr. </p>

These 2 Fournier forgeries of the 30 k value have the forged
&quot;RASTATT 14 OCT 5-10 V&quot; cancel. Next to it a Fournier
forgery with a forged &quot;8&quot; cancel as shown above. Also a
&quot;KEHL 2 NOV 6-7N&quot; cancel. Note the white break in the
lower right hand side of the upper left corner ornament. </p>

Other forgery of the 18 k with '220' four-ring cancel (image
obtained thanks to Eric Aulagner). In my view, this is not a
Baden cancel (it also does not appear in the Fournier Album).
According to the Serrane guide, the leaf pattern below the shield
and the upper right hand corner are different. </p>

(Fournier forgeries with '8' in a small circle cancel and Rastatt
cancel, reduced sizes)</p>

<p>Fournier is known to have made forgeries of the 30 kr. He took
ordinary 3-kreuzer stamps of the 1862 issue, where the colour was
chemically removed, and later reprinted it in orange, from a
forged engraving of the rare 30-kreuzer value. During the two
operations, the cancellation was not removed. So, these forgeries
have the paper, perforation and cancellation genuine and are very
dangerous! Fournier seems to have considered this forgery one of
his masterpieces (this text is translated from Serrane, in the
french introduction of the 'Fournier album of philatelic
forgeries'). A similar text can also be found in the Serrane
Guide. The Serrane Guide also mentions that the 18 kreuzer was
forged in a similar fashion. </p>

genuine '79' numeral cancel. </p>
