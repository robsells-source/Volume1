<hr>

<p>Julius Goldner was a stamp dealer in Hamburg (Germany), who
sold enormous quantities of reprints of Hamburg, Helgoland and
forgeries of Bergedorf, Transvaal, Ecuador and Romagna (see
'Philatelic Forgers, their Lives and Works' by Varro Tyler).
Goldner was born in 1848 and died in 1898. <br>
The Bund Deutscher Philatelisten mentions June 1842 and 14
January 1898 as dates when Goldner was born and died
respectively. According to this source he started dealing stamps
in Hamburg in the early 1860's. His three sons and his wife
continued his business after his death. In 1939 the (Jewish) firm
was confiscated
(https://www.kulturgutverluste.de/Content/03_Forschungsfoerderung/Projekt/Museum-fuer-Kommunikation-Berlin/Projekt1_en.html),
the Reichpostmuseum in Berlin obtained the Helgoland and Romagna
printing plates, 160 cancels and 8 bags with forgeries.<br>
In 'The Day' newspaper of July 25, 1898, we can read: &quot;<em>Julius
Goldner, the wholesale dealer of Hamburg, whose death was
reported, is said to have made $500,000 during the 35 years he
was in the stamp business</em>&quot;. <br>
His business must have survived since &quot;<em>Julius Goldner,
Briefmarken-Großhandel, Hohe Bleichen 31/35</em>&quot; was
victim of the 'Kristalnacht' of 9 to 10 November 1938, in which
many Jewish businesses were destroyed (source:
http://www.tagderjuedischenkultur.de/novemberprogrom/projekt.html).
</p>

<p>Besides making 'reprints' he also acquired the remainders of
the postal due stamps of Baden (see there) and many postage
stamps of Prussia. He was also involved in making reprints of
Prussia (source Paul Ohrt, Handbuch der Neudrucke). </p>

<h4>Hamburg:</h4>

<p>For the specialist: these stamps have a watermark wavy lines.
Reprints were made in 1872, but these reprints don't have any
watermark are printed on yellowish paper and have thinner
'guidelines' between the stamps. Genuine stamps have perforation
13 1/2. Some reprints have perforation 11 1/2. The reprints exist
in all kind of color shades (as the genuine stamps). They were
made by the printer of the genuine stamps C.Adler of Hamburg and
later sold by the stamp dealer <strong>Julius Goldner</strong>.
At first the same perforation machines were used as for the
genuine stamps, but later a new perforation machine which
perforated the stamps 11 1/2 instead of 13 1/2 was used. A very
small number of reprints on watermarked paper also exist. Goldner
also ordered some reprints of non-existing essays (on
unwatermarked paper) with the colors inverted, thus 1 1/4 s green
and 2 1/2 s lilac. Furthermore some phantasy prints were made of
both stamps in bogus colors. For a full description of the
history of these reprints, see Ohrt, Handbuch der Neudrucke (in
German). </p>

Goldner made reprints of the two above stamps of Hamburg. They
don't have any watermark. </p>

<p align="left">Goldner acquired the remainders of Hamburg for
900 Thalers. He stored them in a damp place which spoilt the gum
of many of them. These remainders were then later sold without
gum (source: Bund Deutscher Philatelisten). A circular cancel
with 'HAMBURG' and two stars on each side was used to cancel
remainders (to increase the value of the stamp) of Hamburg which
were acquired by Goldner. This cancel was only used as an arrival
cancel on envelopes, but never to cancel stamps! So these stamps
are genuine stamps with a fake cancel. However, the book
'Handbuch der Neudrucke' by Ohrt says on page 348 that these
cancels themselves were also forged. According to Ohrt, the stars
in the above forged cancels are much larger. </p>

<h4 align="left">Hannover:</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/hannasis10.jpg"><img

width="364" height="175"><br>
A mini sheet of 10 Goldner reprints with tete-beche stamps of the
1/2 Gr posthorn stamp of Hannover. Goldner reprints have a single
line instead of two lines as connection between the mouthpiece
and the horn. Reduced size. He also made reprints in sheets of 50
(10 x 5) with no tete-beche stamps. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat/hann6d.jpg" alt="Reprint!"

Most likely a Goldner reprint of the 3 Pf stamp of Hanover. </p>

<h4 align="left">Helgoland:</h4>

<p align="left">Goldner produced also enormous quantities
(millions) of reprints of Helgoland. See also
http://www.fritzwagner.com/helgoland/goldner_and_his_reprints.html
for more details. </p>

<h4 align="left">Prussia</h4>

<p align="left">The<strong> Permanentes Handbuch der
Postfreimarkenkunde Erster Teil Deutsche Staaten, Abschnitt XIII:</strong>
Preussen by Hugo Krötzsch (1896), page 121 (585) says that the
second reprint of 1873 of the stamps of Prussia was initiated by
Goldner. He paid a certain amount to the war victims fund in
return for the reprints. See also Paul Ohrt's book 'Handbuch der
Neudrucke'. Goldner also acquired previously the remainders of
Prussia. </p>

<h4 align="left">Saxony</h4>

<p align="left">I've been told that the next forgery of Saxony
was made by Goldner as well. I'm not sure if this information is
correct. </p>

This forgery sold with some other stamps of Saxony for 1110 Euros

<h4 align="left">Transvaal</h4>

<p align="left">The reprints of Transvaal, as made by the printer
of the genuine stamps, Otto (Gustrow, Mecklenburg-Schwerin), were
also sold by Goldner. Examples of such reprints: </p>
