<hr>

<p>Placido Ramon de Torres was born in 1850 in Spain (source:
http://www.philahistorica.de/Dokumente/MonacoPhilKatDt.pdf) </p>

<p>Placido Ramon de Torres issued the first Italian stamp
catalogue in 1873 when he was in Livorno (Leghorn, via Maggi
No2). This was merely a pricelist, with only a few images on the
frontpage (it can be downloaded with Google books). The title of
this catalogue was: &quot;<em>Catalogo descrittivo di tutti i
franco-bolli emessi dal 1840 al 1873 colle date di emissione, lor
valore e particolarita in vendita.</em>&quot;, 52 pages, P.R.De
Torres. It is listed in the Bibliografia Italiana under the
&quot;Catalogo Alfabetico delle Pubblicazioni Italiane&quot; of
31 Maggio 1873. During this time he also published a magazin
&quot;La Posta Mondiale&quot;, which ceased to exist after 12
issues. According to Gerhard Lang he was also involved in
preparing essays of Italian local revenue stamps for various
cities. </p>

<p>Placido Ramon de Torres issued the &quot;<em><strong>Album
Illustrado para Sellos de Correo</strong></em>&quot; in 1879
(information passed to me thanks to Gerhard Lang, 2016). This
catalogue has illustrations of some of the stamps. Here are some
examples of the images from this catalogue that correspond to
forgeries. Either these forgeries were inspired by the de Torres
catalogue, or de Torres copied images of forgeries into his
catalogue. In many instances, the same images also appear in
&quot;The illustrated catalogue of postage stamps&quot; by
J.E.Gray of 1870. It is possible that most (if not all) of these
images were used to produce forgeries.</p>

<p>According to the book 'Philatelic forgers, their lives and
works', de Torres lived in Malaga in 1886, when he was arrested
on a sales trip to Bremen (Germany) but managed to escape. <br>
Afterwards, in 1892, he went under the alias of Rosendo Fernandez
on another sales trip to Cuba, Mexico and the United States.
Again he was arrested for selling forgeries. <br>
When he came back to Spain, he took part in the 1893 Melilla
bogus stamp issue. </p>

green. The design of this forgery is identical to the image given
in &quot;The illustrated catalogue of postage stamps&quot; by
J.E.Gray (1870, page 11, see third image). A similar image
appears in the catalogue of de Torres of 1879 on page 28 (fourth

Rather blur forgery of British Columbia and Vancouver Island with
wrong perforation (11 1/2 instead of 14). It even exists in the
color blue (with printed perforation). The design is similr to
one given in &quot;The illustrated catalogue of postage
stamps&quot; by J.E.Gray (1870, page 105). A similar image
appears in the catalogue of de Torres' album of 1879 on page 183.</p>

Genuine 1857 stamp of Brunswick (first image). Next to it a
forgery which I have been told was made by the forger Young. Note
the very large space between &quot;Gute&quot; and &quot;gr&quot;.
The design of this forgery is identical to the image given in
&quot;The illustrated catalogue of postage stamps&quot; by
J.E.Gray (1870, page 13, see second image).A similar image

Confederate States 1 c. The first image shows a cut from a Scott
album of 1886, second and third forgeries based on this cut. The
face is very strange and the &quot;O&quot; of &quot;ONE&quot; is
placed too low. Actually, this 'forgery-image' already appeared
earlier in &quot;The illustrated catalogue of postage
stamps&quot; by J.E.Gray of 1870 on page 115 (fourth iamge). It
also appeared in the catalogue of <a href="torres2.htm">Placido

Actually, this 'forgery-image' Actually, very similar
'forgery-images' already appeared earlier in Le Timbre Poste of
February 1864 of <a href="moens2.htm">Moens</a> (page 10, or
fourth image above) and in the catalogue of Placido Ramon de
Torres &quot;Album Illustrado para Sellos de Correo&quot; of 1879
(information passed to me thanks to Gerhard Lang, 2016) on page
184 (fifth image). The Moens and de Torres images are slightly
different (see for example the arching in the upper right
ornament).</p>

France (second image; obtained thanks to Mark Toft). Next to it
an image of the &quot;The illustrated catalogue of postage
stamps&quot; by J.E.Gray (1870, page 199, see third image). This
forgery can also be found in the catalogue of Placido Ramon de
Torres on page 63 (fourth image). The &quot;5&quot; and the
&quot;F&quot; interrupt the horizontal lines with a white
interior. Also note the weird shape of the letters &quot;A&quot;
and &quot;S&quot; in the word &quot;FRANCAIS&quot; and other
badly printed letters.&nbsp;There is also an extra horizontal
line in the bottom left corner. In the de Torres image, there are
some lines and smudges under the head that do not appear in any
of the other images. </p>

forgery with the head of the Queen drawn instead of embossed. The
design of this forgery is identical to the image given in
&quot;The illustrated catalogue of postage stamps&quot; by
J.E.Gray (1870, page 206, third image). This forgery can also be
found in the catalogue of Placido Ramon de Torres on page 149

illustrations, the upper left hand side is missing. </p>

Forgery (second image). Primitive forgery with perforation (third
image). The design of this forgery is identical to the image

appears in the catalogue of Placido Ramon de Torres of 1879 on

based on the Gray/de Torres design. </p>

Newfoundland codfish design; genuine stamp (first image). Is the
second image a Moens forgery? Moens, or someone taking the Moens
design, seems to have made a forgery of this stamp (1866 issue),
it can easily be recognized, because it is black instead of
green. Furthermore the numerals are larger than in the genuine
stamp. The third image shows an image from Le Timbre Poste by
Moens No.38, February 1866, page 9. The design of this forgery is
identical to the image given in &quot;The illustrated catalogue
of postage stamps&quot; by J.E.Gray (1870, page 127, fourth
image). A similar image appears in the catalogue of Placido Ramon
de Torres of 1879 on page 227 (last image above). </p>

Genuine New South Wales 2 p blue of the first issue. The second
image shows a mystery item 2 p in color red, which is presumably
a forgery. The design of this forgery is identical to the image
given in &quot;The illustrated catalogue of postage stamps&quot;
by J.E.Gray (1870, page 160, see third image). This forgery can
also be found in the catalogue of Placido Ramon de Torres of 1879
on page 243 (fourth image). It appears that de Torres copied the
image from Gray, since the 'cut and paste' lines can still be
seen. The other three images were probably made by de Torres
himself (since the Gray catalogue does not have these images).</p>

Reunion 15 c of the first issue; first image genuine stamp,

from each other and &quot;R&quot; of &quot;Reunion&quot; touches
the circle below it. The design of this forgery is identical to
the image given in &quot;The illustrated catalogue of postage
stamps&quot; by J.E.Gray (1870, page 94, see fourth image above).
A similar image appears in the the catalogue of de Torres of 1879
(page 242, fifth image above).</p>

Genuine stamp of Sarawak and forgery, the lettering is different
(for example the bottom right &quot;S&quot;) and the face of
Brooke as well. The third image shows an image of Le Timbre Poste
by Moens of No 145 January 1875 on which the forgery was
apparently based. This forgery can also be found in the catalogue
of de Torres (page 157 under Africa, while is should be Asia!).
So presumably this forgery was inspired by the Moens catalogue,
and then copied by de Torres. Further proof of this is the fact
that the 'perforation' design is cut off at the top and bottom by
de Torres.</p>

St.Christopher genuine 6 p stamp (first image). All the next
stamps are forgeries, the Queen has a very hooked nose and looks
very 'sour'. Also the inscription in the 3 p reads 'Three Pence'
instead of &quot;THREEPENCE&quot;. Note that the word &quot;SIX
PENCE&quot; in the green and brown forgery are written much
larger than in the orange ones. A similar image appears in the
catalogue of Placido Ramon de Torres of 1879 on page 211.</p>

St.Lucia first issue, genuine stamp (first image). All other
stamps show a set of primitive forgeries with very thick
lettering; note for example the right hand side of the
&quot;A&quot; of &quot;POSTAGE&quot;. There is also a break in
the outer shape of the ellipse just before the 'P' of 'POSTAGE'.
The last one with &quot;2 1/2 PENCE&quot; does not have this
break, which might indicate that the other forgeries were made
after the overprint was erased. A similar image appears in the
catalogue of de Torres of 1879 on page 218. The de Torres stamp
does not have the break in front of the &quot;P&quot;.</p>

Two 'SW' forgeries from Victoria (1853). These corner letters do

Victoria genuine 5 Sh stamp of 1868 and a <a href="senf.htm">Senf</a>
forgery with printed perforation. I have seen it with the
perforation 'cut out' and the word &quot;FALSCH&quot; overprinted
with a manual cancel (see:
http://stampsofvictoria.com/laureates.php). The curly design at
the bottom of the stamp is inverted. Also the ornament at 10
o'clock is missing. This image appears to have been copied from
an illustration in the magazine Le Timbre Poste by <a
href="moens2.htm">Moens</a>, No.68, page 58, August 1868 (the
same image also appears in the same journal in Nr.63, March 1868,
