<p>These islands can be found near Western Australia. The stamps
are completely bogus and issued somewhere around 1952. It seems
that at that time these islands were used as test places for
atomic bombs by Great Britain (and were therefore in the news). </p>

the islands), 3 p green on lilac (ship) and 6 p yellow (primitive
cave paintings).</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="clip"></a>CLIPPERTON ISLAND</h1>

<p align="left">Some bogus stamps were issued for Clipperton
Island (1895). I have seen in all slightly different designs: 1
brown, 1 red(?), 2 green, 3 orange, 4 red, 5 brown, 8 green, 10
orange, 25 blue, 50 lilac, $1 black.</p>

<p align="left">The above stamp is cancelled with &quot;W.FRESE
&amp; CO SAN FRANCISCO Agents FOR O.P.Co&quot; in violet. I have
also seen uncancelled stamps.</p>

<p align="left">In 'The Philatelic Record' of March 1898, page
64, the following text can be found: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Amongst the journals which joined in the
exposure of this rubbish was the American Journal of Philately,
the leading American Philatelic Journal. Subsequently the Scott
Stamp &amp; Coin Co., in their Catalogue listed this rubbish
under the head of &quot;'Fraudulent Issues.&quot; Upon this they
received the following letter which was addressed to dealers in
San Francisco, who were selling their catalogue :<br>
San Francisco, January 14th, 1890.<br>
Dear Sirs : My attention has been called to your Standard Postage
Catalogue, 56th edition, in which you refer on page 617 to
Clipperton Island Stamps under &quot;fraudulent issues.&quot;
Since my name is connected with these stamps, I strongly protest
against this expression! Under date of April 4th 1895, at a
meeting of the Board of Directors of the Oceanic Phosphate
Company, the legal owners of Clipperton Island and its Guano
deposits, situated about 110° W 10° N. in the Pacific, I was
authorised to issue a set of stamps, illustrating features of
Clipperton Island. These stamps were intended for local use
between Clipperton Island and San Francisco, and as an
advertisement for the products of Clipperton Island only. Since I
do not offer, and never did offer, these stamps for sale to stamp
collectors or dealers, I fail to see with what authority you
claim &quot;fraud.&quot; I request you to withdraw the Clipperton
Island stamps from the space &quot;Fraudulent Issues,'' or
otherwise bear the consequences.<br>
Very respectfully, W. Frese.<br>
In this letter it will be noted that Mr. W. Frese &quot;states
that he does not offer, and never did offer, these stamps for
sale to stamp collectors or stamp dealers.&quot; Here he has
over-reached himself, for Messrs. Whitfield King &amp; Co.
received from Messrs. Frese &amp; Co. a letter distinctly
offering unused sets at face value, and furthermore stating that
a limited number of sets of cancelled stamps could be supplied at
a rebate of 25 per cent, on face value. Apparently the impudence
of these San Francisco speculators knows no limit.</em></p>

<p align="left">Much later, in 1958, stamps of Australia with the
face of Queen Elizabeth, with overprint 'Christmas Island' were
issued (10 values), in 1965 more stamps followed (Anzac issue, 1
stamp) and a new definitive set was issued in 1968 (fishes, 12
values).</p>
