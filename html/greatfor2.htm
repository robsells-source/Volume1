<h4>Forgeries:</h4>

<p>I have seen imperforate souvenir sheets (?) with the 1 Pound
and 5 Pounds stamps on it, with very large borders (about the
size of the stamp itself), at the bottom the year the stamp was
issued is indicated in very large letters. I don't know who
issued these sheets, but they have been issued in large
quantities. Example of such a sheet:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/gbfacs2.jpg" width="685"
height="481"><br>
(1 pound brown facsimile sheet)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/gbfacs1.jpg" width="922"

href="great2/repr5.jpg"><img src="great2/repr5.jpg" border="0"
width="789" height="571"></a><br>
Sheet with 5 Pound forgery, reduced size. Next to it the same
reprint in green. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/gbfacsim1.jpg" width="378"
height="243"><br>
Cut from this same sheet with '1882' removed, with rather worn
impression behind the Queen's head. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/fornowmk1.jpg" width="699"
height="410"><br>
Forgery with no watermark, possible perforated cut from the above
souvenir sheet </p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/gbfacsimile1.jpg" width="804"
height="504"> <img src="great2/forg21.jpg" width="689"
height="412"><br>
Possibly the same forgery as above, with &quot;EDINBURGH JA 8
96&quot; cancel. This forgery also appears in the Barefoot guide
of Great Britain. It is said to have been produced somewhere in
the 1970's. It always has letters 'AA'. It has an impressed
watermark. I've also seen it with the cancel &quot;C JERSEY NO 16
98&quot;.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/forg22.jpg" width="674"
height="407"><br>
The same &quot;AA&quot; forgery with forged &quot;WORCESTER 1245
PM DE 8 99&quot; cancel. </p>

<p align="left">Another forgery has impossible &quot;AQ&quot;
corner letters, it is called the Paris forgery and first appeared
around 1928. It often has a &quot;STIRLING 1 JA 5 89&quot; cancel
(source: http://www.stampauctions.co.uk/5pound/f74.jpg). <br>
</p>

<p align="left">Another forgery has impossible &quot;DO&quot;
corner letters and sometimes a forged &quot;REGISTERED A2 3 AP 02
LOMBARD ST.&quot; cancel. It was made by Peter Winter. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/gbWinter2.jpg" width="639"
height="1024"><br>
Peter Winter forgeries.</p>

<p align="left">The forger <a href="winter3.htm">Peter Winter</a>
has made forgeries of the 1 Pound brown, 1 Pound green and 5
Pounds orange Queen Victoria stamps. He also offers a forgery of
the 5 Pounds telegraph Queen Victoria stamp. Images can be found
in the 'House of Stamps Edition 88' catalogue. There, they are
cancelled on pieces of paper with the cancels &quot;REGISTERED A2
3 AP LOMBARD ST.&quot; in an ellipse, &quot;LUDLOW MY 9
1894&quot; curved text cancel, &quot;HONITON NO 29 18..&quot; and
&quot;1&quot; numeral cancel in a lozenge surrounded by lines. He
also offers the 5 Pounds stamp on letter. </p>

height="1530"><br>
Forgery of the 5 Pounds value with the head of the Queen slanting
too much forwards. Possibly also made by the same forger, since
I've seen it with the above shown &quot;TORQUAY H DE 1....&quot;
partial cancel, which I have also seen on other forgeries of
Great Britain. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="great2/forg23.jpg" width="640"
height="399"><br>
&quot;DI&quot; forgery with &quot;WIGAN AM DE 20 99&quot; cancel.
I've also seen it with the same cancel placed in a different
position. </p>
