George Carion as illustrated as a drawing in The San Francisco
Call, Thursday, August 6, 1896 during his accusations in San
Francisco. An almost identical photo appears in La Revue
Francaise des Collectionneurs of 1904.</p>

<p align="left">Georges Carion was born in Paris in April 1858
(source: La Revue Francaise des Collectionneurs of 1904).
According to 'Philatelic Forgers, their Lives and Works' Georges
Carion was a stamp forger. He started of in Paris in 1879 with
the firm Carion &amp; Emden (Jules Emden). <br>
He then went to Tahiti, where he was forced to leave after some
scandal over forged <strong>Tahiti </strong>overprints. <br>
He then moved to San Francisco in 1894 (I've seen a letter from
1895 with address P.O.Box 2457 San Francisco) to follow Jules
Emden who moved there earlier (according to the La Revue
mentioned above, La Revue mentions the year 1893 for Carion's
departure to San Francisco). Indeed a merchant Jules Emden, age
27, from France together with a certain merchant Lucien Emden,
age 32, are listed as passengers on an immigrant ship of 7 August
1893 from Havre, France to New York (see
https://immigrantships.net/v5/1800v5/lachampagne18930807_01.html)<br>
His most famous forgeries are the &quot;COCHINCHINE&quot;
overprints. He also made forged overprints of <strong>Obock</strong>
(see V.E.Tyler; 'Philatelic Forgers, their Lives and Works').
Carion went back to France afterwards in 1899. I've seen a used
letter from him addressed to Rudolf Friedl in Austria in 1896
from 83 Rue Lemercier Paris (not Lemergier as erroneously stated
in Philatelic Forgers by V.E.Tyler, see the image later on). In
1901 he was doing business as George Carion (without
&quot;s&quot;) from 29. Rue Legendre Paris. I've seen a letter
from 1941 with Geo Carion, from the address 21, Rue Nollet, Paris
(17e). The article in La Revue Francaise des Collectionneurs of
1904 does not mention anything about his 'dubious' activities,
but does mention that he has a great collection of rare stamps
from Hawai and the French colonies (especially Tahiti). </p>

Carion than anything else):<br>
<em>Notes Biographiques<br>
M. Georges CARION<br>
Né à Paris en avril 1858, M.Georges Carion était encore sur
les bancs due Collèges lorsqu'il commença à prendre goût à
la philatélie, presque aussitôt il remarqua le parti qu pouvait
tirer des timbres un commerçant adroit et travailleur.<br>
A douze ans, il traitait déja des affaires importantes.<br>
En 1884, il publia une petite feuille technique, Le Bulletin
Mensuel des nouveautés, et en 1885 : La Timbrologie. Faute de
temps, il dut cesser, à son grand regret, la publication de ces
périodiques.<br>
Il s'adjoignit pour son commerce en 1888, M.Jules Emden qui
partit pour San-Francisco où M.Carion all la rejoindre en 1893,
c'est dans cette ville et à partir de cette époque, qu'il
acquit une célébrité philatélique quasi-mondiale.<br>
Il fut tour à tour: Expert de la Société Philatélique de
San-Francisco, de la Southern Philatélic Association, des
Philatélic sons of America, membre d'honneur du Métropolitan
Philatélic Club de San Antonio, vice-président de la Columbian
Philatélic Society, vice-président de la League of American
Philatélists, vice-président des Canadian Philatélic
Association, membre de l'American Philatélic Press Association
et de nombreuses sociétés.<br>
En 1899, il rentra à Paris, rapportant un superbe stock de
timbres rares particulièrement d'Hawai, Tahiti, etc..<br>
M.Georges Carion n'est pas seulement un Philatéliste distingué,
il est encore écrivain conscencieux et chercheur souvent
heureux, il produisit un grand nombre d'études scientifiques due
plus haut intérêt, reproduites par une foule de journaux.<br>
Il s'ets fait une spécialité des timbres des colonies
françaises dont il possède un assortiment des plus variés et
qu'il est le premier à avoir spécialisés. Sa collection de
Tahiti contient des variétés très rares et excessivement peu
connues, peut-être un jour aurons-nous le plaisir d'en donner la
primeur à nos lecteurs.</em></p>

are addressed to Samuel Grosh or Reynolds &amp; Co. (considered
to be part of the Tandler correspondence) and have a genuine red
Wells Fargo Sacramento hand stamp applied to a stampless cover.
The Black &amp; Co. Express franks were believed to have been
added to deceive buyers by Georges Carion, a Bay Area stamp
dealer; however, Wiltsee in his &quot;Pioneer Miner and Pack Mule
Express&quot; (p106) notes that it operated between Sacramento
and San Francisco but gives no information on its background.<br>

<p>Also, in &quot;The Ontario Philatelist &quot; (Vol.1, No.6
September 1896 p. 42.) some 'suspicious' activity of Carion can
be found. I hereby reproduce the text of this article in full: <br>
<em><br>
CHARGES WITHOUT PROOF<br>
They Caused a Great Sensation Among Local Stamp Collectors<br>
Georges Carion has Received a Letter of Exoneration from New York<br>
from the San Francisco Call of August 20<br>
About two weeks ago one of the greatest sensations in the history
of the local philatelic or stamp-collecting fraternity was
produced by the publication of certain charges made against
Georges Carion by his ex-clerk, George M. Schiller.<br>
The latter claimed that he had entrusted to his former employer a
consignment of French colonial stamps valued at $400, and that
Carion had taken certain valuable stamps from the books in which
they were fastened, and had substituted counterfeits and inferior
specimens.<br>
Schiller followed up this remarkable accusation by securing a
search warrant for Carion's premises, with the object of
recovering the alleged missing stamps, but the search was without
result.<br>
Meanwhile, Carion, in the presence of reliable witnesses, sealed
the stamps, among which were alleged to be the counterfeits, in
an envelope, and forwarded them by registered mail to the
consignors, the Scott Stamp and Coin Company (limited) of New
York city, with the following letter :<br>
<br>
SAN FRANCISCO AUG. 5, 1896.<br>
Dear Sir : I have sent by registered mail the four books of
French colonies, which you had sent on approval to Geoge M.
Schiller, and from which I have retained stamps to the amount of
$14.91, which amount I will remit by next mail.<br>
Please examine the stamps very carefully, as Mr. Schiller has
insinuated that<br>
some of them have been substituted or replaced by poor or less
valuable specimens. Please acknowledge receipt of stamps to Mr.
Schiller, and let me know at once about the matter.<br>
<br>
This brought forth a prompt reply from the New York firm, and one
which Mr. Carion and his friends consider a complete refutation
of the charges made by Mr. Schiller. This communication follows :<br>
<br>
SAN FRANCISCO<br>
Georges Carion, San Francisco, Cal.<br>
DEAR SIR : We have received your letter of the 5th, and also the
tour approval books of French colonies stamps by registered mail.
We find your statement of account is correct, the net amount of
$14.90 having been removed.<br>
We have looked through the books, and so far as we can remember,
and to best of our belief, the stamps remaining in the books are
those which were originally there. As requested we, shall write
Mr. Schiller to that effect.<br>
<br>
In view of this exoneration of Mr. Carion, mystery shrouds the
motive by Schiller and leaves, the latter in a rather peculiar
position. Mr. Carion is inclined to look upon his ex-employe's
action in a charitable manner, and attributes it to a
hallucintation.<br>
