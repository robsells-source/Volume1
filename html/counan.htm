<p>Counani is a region somewhere between French Guyana and
Brazil, the borders were not really established well in the 19th
century between these two countries. A certain Jules Gros
proclamed himself president of the 'republic of independant
Guyana'. This 'republic' was ended in 1877. However, in 1892 a
new person, Adolphe Brezet, tried to establish a new republic,
but he also failed to do so. Some bogus stamps (33 different
stamps) were issued from 1887 to 1893. The full story of these
stamps can be found in 'Les timbres de phantasie' of Georges
Chapier (in french).</p>
