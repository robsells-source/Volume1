<p>Bernhardt Assmus, born in Hamburg Germany, moved to Paris
first and then to London around 1877 as a journalist. He got
arrested after selling some forged &quot;VR&quot; penny black
stamps to stamp dealer Morris Gwelb in 1890. </p>

<p>After searching his house, the police found 18 printing plates
and more than 4000 forgeries, among them those of Lady McLeod and
inverted 4 Annas from India. </p>

<p>I have no examples of the forgeries he sold at the moment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This seems to have been the first trial regarding stamp
forgeries, here the trial proceedings, reprinted from Philatelic
Journal of Great Britain March 1, 1892; see also:

<p>[TRANSCRIPT FROM THE SHORTHAND NOTES OF H. H. AND A. R.
TOLCHER]</p>

<p>At the Central Criminal Court, on Monday, February 8th, 1892,
before the Common Serjeant, Sir W. T. CHARLEY.</p>

<p>Counsel for the prosecution, Mr. C. F. Gill and Mr. A. Gill
(instructed by J. G. Frayling, Esq., solicitor to the Treasury).</p>

<p>The prisoner was Undefended.</p>

<p>Mr.C.F. GILL.: May it please your lordship, gentlemen of the
jury. The prisoner at the bar is charged in this indictment with
obtaining money by false pretences, and on some counts with
attempting to obtain money by false pretences. The case is rather
a peculiar one, having regard to the method adopted by the
prisoner for obtaining money, and as regards the cases in which
he failed to carry out his object. As no doubt all of you are
aware, there are many people now, and have been for many years
past, who collect foreign stamps The practice is not confined
merely to boys at school, but people of riper years take a very
great interest in that subject, and put themselves to a great
deal of trouble and expense for the purpose of completing
collections, as far as they can, of all stamps that have ever
been issued. You can well understand, therefore, that there are a
number of stamps very easily procured. But a certain number of
stamps, a very few of which are in existence, it is very
difficult to procure ; and as time goes on, they become more
valuable day by day. Some of them have some peculiarity which
adds very much to their value. Some are valuable on account of
their colour. But in the cases that will be brought before you we
only deal with three or four stamps which were put upon members
of the public by the prisoner, who, it is alleged, is a man
engaged in the wholesale production of forged stamps, designed to
supply the want that is felt for rare stamps. He has devoted
great attention to this subject, and was found to be in
possession of all the plant necessary to turn out any quantity
that might be desired. As time went on, the price no doubt would
have come down ; but when he was arrested there were found on
him, and in his possession, a large number of stamps, dies,
colours, paints, acids, and a variety of things of that kind,
which would be useful to him in his business of adding to the
value of foreign stamps by altering their appearance. In order to
give you an instance of how a stamp may be made valuable by
forging some part of it, I may say it appears that there is a
black English stamp which most of you, I dare say, have seen. It
has in one top corner the letter &#147;V,&#148; and in the other
corner the letter &#147;R.&#148; The great bulk of that issue of
stamps had a Maltese cross in the corner; but a small number were
issued with the letters &#148; V.R,&#148; and only a small
number, because the distribution was almost immediately stopped.
So that although there are a large number of black 1d. English
stamps not in circulation, but in the possession of different
people, and are comparatively easily obtained, yet there are very
few with the &#147;V.R.&#148; It is suggested that this man
devoted his attention to altering this stamp as a means of
obtaining money, because, whereas the black stamp with the
Maltese cross is worth very little, the stamp with the
&#147;V.R.&#148; is of very great value indeed. The allegation is
that he has forged the &#147;V.R.&#148; in the corners, using, as
a basis, the ordinary black stamp.</p>

<p>The Prisoner: I am not prosecuted for forgery.</p>

<p>Mr.C.F. GILL: Well, gentlemen, having altered the stamp in
that way, he proceeded to try and sell it. He told some story as
to how it got into his possession, which is untrue. He is a man
of considerable capacity and ability, as will, no doubt, be shown
before you in the course of this case. Evidence will be produced
to show how he got possession of it. He then proceeded to take it
to dealers in stamps who would be likely to buy them for
customers desirous of obtaining valuable stamps.</p>

<p>A JUROR: Was the prisoner in any regular business other than
the supposed manufacture of these stamps?</p>

<p>Mr.C.F. GILL: I will tell you, sir, what his position was. It
may be convenient to answer your question at once by saying that
he had no occupation that we know of at that time, and, indeed,
we are quite certain, except this busi-ness of dealing in these
spurious and altered stamps. All the stamps found at his place
were not forged, of course; but we say that was the thing he
devoted his attention to, and that he had all the plant necessary
to do it, and he was in possession, at the time of his arrest, of
forged stamps other than those which he is charged with obtaining
money upon.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, I will give you a few dates. You will find
that in July, 1890, he was in possession of one of these 1d.
black English stamps with the letters &#147;V.R.&#148; in the
corners. He took it, first of all, to Mr. Buhl, a gentleman
carrying on business in Queen Victoria Street ; but he did not
succeed in getting rid of it, because Mr. Buhl was not satisfied
with it. I shall prove before you that took place as far back as
July, 1890, so as to show he had in his possession a stamp having
in the corners the letters &#147;V.R.,&#148; which would not, to
his knowledge, be accepted by a man skilled and expert in these
matters. On August 12th of the same year he went to another
gentleman, a stamp dealer, in Leicester Square, and offered him a
black English stamp with the letters &#147;V.R.&#148; in the
corners. He said he had got it from an old gentleman in whose
possession it had been for a long time, and he sold it to Mr.
Giwelb for £4. As a matter of fact, if you can find a person who
wants a stamp of this kind at the time of disposing of it, it
would be worth more than £4 ; but that was the price paid by Mr.
Giwelb, who is himself a dealer, and who could have sold it, if
genuine, at a profit. It will be proved to you that that stamp is
one of those which I have described as the ordinary English stamp
which would have had the Maltese cross in the corners, but which
has been altered by having the letters &#147;V.R.&#148; inserted
instead. On the 18th August he sold another stamp &#150; <font
color="#FF0000"><strong>a 12 cents Mexican stamp</strong></font>
&#150; to the same gentleman for 15s. That stamp was given a
value by altering the colour of it. Sometimes stamps of exactly
the same description are issued, but of a different colour. It
seems to be the fact that the green Mexican stamp at that time
was comparatively of trifling value, but the brown one was much
more rare, and would command, therefore, a much larger price ; in
fact, the difference was so great that a dealer would sell the
green 12 cents Mexican stamp for 3d. or 4d., whereas the brown
one would be worth from £2 to £3. The reason of that, again, is
that in issuing these stamps some of the Mexican stamps were
issued of a brown colour by accident, and they got into
circulation. Of course, they were withdrawn from circulation at
once; but that gives them their value to collectors &#150; I mean
the fact of their being rare. In passing, I ought to have
mentioned that, with regard to this black English stamp, the
prisoner had in his possession, among the plant for carrying on
this business, a die which could be used for producing these
letters &#147;V.R.&#148; in the corners. Again, in December,
1890, he went to the shop of a Mr. Reya, of Oxford Street, who
occasionally purchases foreign stamps. He will tell you that the
prisoner called upon him on the 3rd December, 1890, and produced
a 4 annas Indian stamp with this peculiarity &#150; that the
Queen&#146;s head was upside down. For that reason the stamp was
of considerable value. The prisoner told Mr. Reya some story
about it, and Mr. Reya bought it for £7 10s. He subsequently
sold it to another gentleman, who is in the habit of purchasing
stamps, for £15 and it was eventually sold for £20. It will be
proved, with reference to that stamp, that the way in which the
thing was done was by taking out part of the stamp, reversing the
Queen&#146;s head, and so producing a valuable stamp. Dealing
with ordinary stamps that has to be done with great skill, and in
such a way as to deceive the eyes of those persons who would even
look very closely at them. He was at that time in communication
with a witness whom I shall call before you, to whom he spoke
with regard to stamps, and you will hear that the question of
taking the Queen&#146;s head out of the first issue of the four
anna Indian stamp, and reversing it, was the subject of
discussion, and the prisoner made the observation that he could
practically do anything he pleased with stamps.</p>

<p>Then, gentlemen, on December 22nd the prisoner sold a <font
color="#FF0000"><strong>blue Cape of Good Hope stamp</strong></font><strong>
</strong>to Mr. Reya. The value of that stamp depends on its
colour. A large number can be bought cheaply of another colour,
but the blue stamp is worth a considerable sum, being rare. The
red stamp is the cheap colour, but that colour can be altered by
the use of acids; and in the possession of the prisoner were
found acids that would be useful for that purpose.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, another case is that of Mr. Bright, of Bournemouth.
The prisoner seems to have been in communication with him by
means of correspondence, and he wrote from Church Street,
Islington, the place where he had taken rooms and where he
received letters. He passed there in the names of
&#147;Assmus&#148; and &#147;Bernard.&#148; The point with regard
to his passing by two names is that in the correspondence to Mr.
Bright he said he was desirous of introducing Mr. Assmus to Mr.
Bright ; and later on he went there in another capacity for the
purpose of introducing himself as Mr. Assmus. That shows the
trouble he took to carry out these frauds. [The learned counsel
read some extracts from the correspondence]. I need not read all
the letters to you, but it is plain that he was sending stamps to
these people who had the means of disposing of them in their
business. The Baden stamps which he mentioned are not stamps
which have been altered or manipulated in any way, but they are
absolutely forged altogether. Any alteration of a stamp would be
a forgery ; but these are the entire productions of the prisoner.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the matter, goes on ; and on the 1st October he
writes again to the same people, saying this : &#148; I am sorry
to say I could not answer your favour, of September 22nd, which I
duly received with the returned stamps. Dr. Assmus &#148; (this
is what he is writing of himself),&#148; an old friend of mine
who has the whole matter about the collection in hand, is in
Paris on some important business, and will not be back before
next Monday.&#148; Gentlemen, that refers to this : the prisoner
represented that he knew where there was a valuable collection to
be sold, and that he could use his influence for the purpose of
bringing about the purchase of this very valuable collection by
these people to whom he was writing. He was writing to them in
the name of Bernard, stating that he had friend, Dr. Assmus, who
was quite in touch with the people who were in possession of the
stamps. In another letter he describes Dr. Assmus as a renowned
war correspondent; in fact, writing as &#147;Bernard,&#148; he
speaks in the highest possible terms of Assmus, giving him the
best possible character, and stating that he is a man of great
business capacity. With regard to the last part of the
description of his character, you will probably agree, before the
case is over, that the prisoner is a man of considerable ability
; and it is much to be regretted that be has not devoted his
great capacity to some other object than dealing in spurious
stamps of this kind. Gentlemen, the fact that this kind of thing
was going on to a considerable extent came to the knowledge of
the authorities, and it was thought right that a stop should be
put to it. The police were accordingly instructed to take the
matter up, and this man was arrested. The cases I have mentioned
to you were gone into before the magistrate for the purpose of
showing the nature of the trade in which this man has been
concerned ; and he was committed to take his trial. I have told
you about this place where he lived, at 12, Church Street,
Islington. There were found there in his possession nearly 4,000
stamps along with the other things I have mentioned &#150; the
acids, colours, and paints. Upon him there were 900 stamps, and
among the stamps found upon him there were some which will be
described to you by a gentleman whom I shall call as an expert
witness.</p>

<p>A JUROR : Do I understand that the prisoner was arrested on
the 21st November last?</p>

<p>Mr.C.F. GILL: Yes. The first date I gave you in connection
with this transaction was July, 1890. The matter went on from
July, 1890, to November of last year. Gentlemen, those are all
the facts I think it necessary to bring to your attention at this
stage of the case. I think you will be satisfied that this
indictment is well supported by the evidence ; and, if you are of
that opinion, you will say the prisoner is guilty.</p>

<p>[The witnesses were then called on behalf of the prosecution,
and gave evidence substantially to the same effect as that
already reported on the hearing before the Police Magistrate.]</p>

<p>THE PRISONER&#146;S DEFENCE.</p>

<p>The PRISONER: Gentlemen, the whole evidence brought forward is
of a very conflicting character. I shall try to explain to you
that I never had the slightest desire to defraud anybody. I will
take the first case. When I sold the black English stamp to the
witness, Giwelb, I went to his shop in the afternoon at about six
o&#146;clock, in the month of August when it was quite day-time,
and I offered him the stamp. He asked the price, and I said £4.
He found that very cheap. He examined it thoroughly through a
magnifying glass in the day-time. I was waiting a long time until
he had quite finished his examination, and then he paid me. He
said, &#147;Yes, I will take the stamp ; but if it is a bad one
you will repay me the money.&#148; That was distinctly agreed
between us. I did not give him any guarantee at all. He did not
even ask me for a guarantee. He thought it was a good one, and
paid me the money with a cheque, and I got the money on the next
day. Therefore, he had time enough to stop the cheque if he had
found out something. He is a dealer in stamps since many years;
he must know about a stamp if it is a good one or a bad one
better than I. I am only a collector. I had a very old collection
stolen from me on the Continent, and I began later on to get a
collection again. Of course, I cannot have the experience what a
dealer has. I thought to know much about the stamps, but I see I
did not know very much. The same with the Mexican stamp. I sent
it to Giwelb in a registered letter, and I sold it for 15s. on
the 17th August to him together with some other stamps. He had,
therefore, time enough to examine this stamp thoroughly, and as
well as the expert, Major Evans, who has been explaining to you
that the whole of this stamp has been chemically altered. Again,
Giwelb, as an old dealer, ought to have found that out at once.
Why should I have found it out? I am only a collector. He bought
it. If the stamp appeared suspicious, he wrote, in the letter
which has been produced to the Court, that I should repay him the
money &#150; that is, if it would be found afterwards that the
stamp was not a good one. It is written further on in the same
letter, which I produced, that he sent the black stamp with the
&#147;V.R.&#148; in the corners away. He writes to me: &#148; I
have sent it already away.&#148; Then he comes forward to the
Police &#150; court, and swears at different times &#150; twice
at the Police-court, and also here today again &#150; that he has
not parted with the stamp in any way &#150; that he did not send
it away. But here he acknowledges in his own letter, which is
written with his own hand, &#147;I have sent the &#147;V.R.&#148;
stamp already away.&#148; Then he comes forward and swears,
&#147;I never parted with it, I never sent it away,&#148; as you
have heard. If he thinks he can verbally swear away what lie has
written willingly some months ago, well then,</p>

<p>Gentlemen, that is nothing else but perjury. I asked him how
he would explain it. He says, &#147;I cannot explain it, I cannot
remember.&#148; Gentlemen, the matter is too serious. He must
remember, or he must not come forward here and bring the charge
against me. The same with regard to the Mexican stamp. I gave him
no guarantee. I offered him the stamp to sell it in the same way
as I bought it. He suspected it, and wrote again in the letter
saying, &#147;If it is a bad one you must give me the money
back.&#148; I do not see why I should have had the slightest
intention to defraud him.&#148;</p>

<p>Then, gentlemen, there is the other point. I was arrested on
the 21st November; and, at all events, some days before &#150;
perhaps the 17th or 18th &#150; he swore to an information at the
Police-court that I had defrauded him in some way. On the 21st I
was arrested. That was on a Saturday afternoon, between two and
three o&#146;clock. I was locked up at Vine Street
Police-station. It was not allowed to me to write any letter to
anybody ; so that I could not instruct my solicitor, or tell my
friends what had happened. I was brought up to the Court the next
Monday unprepared. But in the meantime this witness, Giwelb, in
company with another witness, Dannenberg, who had sworn also to
the information, but who was never put into the box for being
cross-examined, and who was dropped by the prosecution after,
this Mr. Giwelb went with Dannenberg to my rooms in company with
the detective for searching my rooms. Now, gentlemen, what had
this man to do in my rooms? He knew perfectly well I was locked
up at Vine Street Police-station on his own instructions. Was he
entitled to go to my rooms? Had he any right or reason there, or
the other private man either? He admitted here he was not invited
by the detective to accompany him ; but the detective afterwards
said he did invite them. However, whether he was invited or not,
he was the man who has charged me with defrauding him, and he
ought not to have gone there. Nobody knows what mischief he may
have done there. The detective was the only person to search ;
but there were two other men. How could he prove he had directed
all his attention to the searching? How could he know what these
two other men were doing? If they were dropping something at my
rooms, or taking something away? Dannenberg has not been examined
here. He has been dropped by the prosecution. He even showed a
paper to somebody which I am informed he said had been found at
my place. I cannot prove it, because I was not out to bring
witnesses here. His presence at my rooms is indeed very
suspicious. Then he says, &#147;I cannot explain why I said I had
returned the stamps.&#148; He may not have had the intention to
incriminate himself, and he is right to do so. These stamps
&#150; the &#147;V.R.&#146;s&#148; &#150; which were found at my
place, I never saw them before in my life, and I do not know
where from they are coming. I never saw them before &#150; never.
It may be that somebody has forgotten them. I do not know. The
stamp I sold to Mr. Giwelb with the &#147;V.R.&#148; in the
corner was returned to me as it is written in the letter. He
admits that, and I say he cannot swear that away afterwards; and
even if he swears he did not send it away, when he has written in
the letter saying he returned it to me, that is nothing but
perjury. So it is the same with his saying he never sent the
stamps away to somebody else. He admitted also the letter saying
he had sent them away. I do not know, therefore, from where these
&#148; V.R.&#146;s&#148; are corning. Then the expert, Mr. Douet,
the gentleman from Somerset House, said also it might be possible
that the &#147;V.&#148; and &#147;R.&#148; in the corners had
been printed with other types than those found at my place.
Certainly, nobody can find out at once with a few little types
whether they are printed the same or not. There are four
different sizes ; and it is quite sufficient that Mr. Douet told
us it is possible that they might have been printed with other
types also. You will ask then, gentlemen, why I have these types
with the &#147;V.R.&#148; in my possession. If I would say a lie
I could say I did not see them before ; but no, gentlemen ; I
know perfectly well they are mine, because I was, ten years ago
&#150; in 1882 and the following years &#150; the proprietor and
editor of the German Gazette, in Paris, and, therefore, I had
always to do with a lot of printing matters. Here is the paper,
and my name is on it. [Producing same.] I brought over a lot of
other types, not alone &#147;V.R&#146;s.&#148; ; but there were
other types at my place, and a lot of printing materials &#150;
colours, and all sorts of things. I myself, because I had some
experience with the &#147;V.R.s,&#148; sold it to Mr. Giwelb ;
and when I was obliged to take it back I found out which types
were the right ones, so that when another one might he offered to
me I could know it. Myself I am not a dealer at all in stamps, I
am a journalist ; but also a stamp collector since a long time. I
saw there was a lot of business done in the sale of stamps, and I
went in a little for speculating in stamps. And yet more, I lost
my money by bad speculations. Some company &#150; promoter
swindled me out of a lot of money; and in this way I thought it
was very agreeable to me to make a few pounds by buying and
selling stamps. I am not a dealer, and have not the experience;
and, furthermore, from this time, when I was publishing the
German paper in Paris, I had different types, only I took the
&#147;V.&#148; and the &#147;R.&#148; to find out what are the
right ones. But nobody could tell me. I asked a lot of people.</p>

<p>Then, gentlemen, there is the other case of the <font
color="#FF0000"><strong>Indian stamp</strong></font> which I
offered to one Mr. Reya. Mr. Reya is an antiquarian bookseller.
He said himself here that he is not a stamp dealer, nor a stamp
collector, he has no knowledge at all of stamps ; but he pretends
that I came to his place, and offered him this stamp for sale.
Why should I go to an antiquarian bookseller, who has no
knowledge of stamps, and offer him a stamp for £8? I went to his
place and offered it to him, but I said to him, &#147;I have had
some disputes with some dealers already, because I am buying and
selling stamps, and my coming into the trade they are jealous,
and whenever I have got a stamp, and bring it on the market, they
say, without looking at it, it is a bad one.&#148; I said to Mr.
Reya, &#147;Will you try to sell it for me? and do not give any
guarantee.&#148; He does not remember that, but never mind. I did
not give him any guarantee. He took the stamp to one Mr.
Phillips, the Managing Director and Secretary of Stanley Gibbons,
Limited, with a share-capital of £20,000, a limited company for
buying and selling stamps. There is a man, as he admitted
himself, who has to do with hundreds of thousands of stamps, and
has a large stock in his possession. They call themselves in
their advertisement the largest dealers in the world. A man like
that ought to have a better knowledge than Mr. Reya, or than I.
Mr. Reya, of course, could not know if the stamp was a good one
or not. I myself thought it was a good one, and I thought they
might find it out themselves whether it was a good one ; and if
such a dealer as Mr. Phillips does not know it, how shall I know
it? Mr. Reya says, and Mr. Phillips admits it, that he examined
the stamp through a magnifying glass, he took it into another
room, and had it about five minutes, and was quite satisfied with
it, and he bought it without any guarantee on his own risk. Then
Major Evans was called. He is an expert, and he says himself,
&#147;Well, I think that Mr. Phillips ought to have been able to
find out if the stamp was a good one or a bad one.&#148; He also
said that he himself would not have bought it. He would have
properly inspected it with a glass before buying such a valuable
stamp. Therefore the only question is, did Mr. Phillips know it
when he bought it? He may have thought, &#147;Well, it looks all
right, it may be a bad one, but I may get a profit out of it, and
I will do it at my own risk.&#148; If he did not know it was a
bad one, why should I know it? If he knew it was a bad one, and
only wanted to make some profit out of it, he bought it on his
own risk. So that however you turn the case, I am without any
fault in that respect. It is not proved at all that this Indian
stamp is absolutely the same one that I sold to Mr. Reya, and
which he sold to Mr. Phillips. Mr. Reya says, &#147;To the best
of my belief it is the same stamp which I sold about a year ago
to Mr. Phillips.&#148; What does that mean, &#147;to the best of
his belief?&#148; He cannot swear to it, he cannot say positively
it is the stamp. &#147;To the best of his belief &#148; is
nothing at all. There is no proof at all in that. And the same
with the <font color="#FF0000"><strong>blue Cape stamp</strong></font>.
He says he cannot give any particular description of it, he says
it is a three-cornered one, but he cannot tell why it is the same
stamp. He said, &#147;I recognise it by the fresh gum on the
back.&#148; Well, gentlemen, there is no gum on the back of that
stamp at all. There is another contradiction. With this blue Cape
stamp it was the same as with the Indian. Mr. Reya said to me,
when I sold him the Indian stamp some time before, &#148; When
you have other good stamps bring them to me, and I will try and
sell them again.&#148; I brought him this Cape stamp. He offered
it again to Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Phillips said at once that the
colour had been altered. That man is a stamp dealer, but he has
no special knowledge of stamps. How can he say when a stamp is
offered at once that the colour has been changed? That could only
be said by a chemist who has analysed the stamp, and not in any
other way. It is quite impossible.</p>

<p>Then the same with the Mexican one. Major Evans also said that
he made experiments in changing the colour of stamps, and,
therefore, he thought the colour had been altered, or, rather, he
was sure it had been altered. Well, gentlemen, he cannot prove
it. Then I asked him if he had ever changed a red one to a blue
one, and he says he did not. How can he say what has been done
about the colour? It has not been proved at all that these are
the same stamps which Mr. Reya sold to Mr. Phillips about a year
ago. Mr. Phillips bought the stamp from Mr. Reya, who took it
with him in his pocket. He offered it afterwards to Mr. Douglas
Garth, a stamp collector, and a member of the committee of the
Philatelic Society; and Mr. Douglas Garth bought it from Mr.
Phillips for £20. Also this Mr. Douglas Garth, who is a renowned
stamp collector, ought to have known if the stamp was a good one
or a bad one ; but it was not necessary in this case, because
Stanley Gibbons give a guarantee for all their stamps. They say
that all stamps sold by them they guarantee as genuine ones.
Therefore, Mr. Douglas Garth bought this Indian stamp from Mr.
Phillips as a genuine one, and he had it about a year in his
possession. Then Mr. Phillips fetched it back from Mr. Garth
afterwards, and Mr. Phillips says now that it is the same stamp.
Notice was given to me by the prosecution that Mr. Garth might be
called as a witness. I did not see him today in the box, and,
therefore, nothing has been proved to show it is the same stamp
as was in the possession of Mr. Garth a year ago. They did not
prove it at all. The stamp changes hands. It was bought, at
first, by Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Phillips sold it to another
person, and this other person had the stamp a whole year in his
collection, and then after a year the stamp came back to Mr.
Phillips. Who can say if it is the same stamp? Mr. Phillips says
it is.</p>

<p>Certainly he wants to go out of his way. Mr. Reya cannot
positively swear it is the same one, which is quite natural, as
he only had it one day in his possession. Nothing has been proved
to show that this Indian stamp was the same stamp which I sold.
Therefore, if this Indian stamp which was produced at the court
is altered, or is a forged one, it makes no difference at all,
because nobody has proved it is the same stamp that I sold.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the other case was Mr. Bright. Mr. Bright is a
dealer at Bournemouth since several years. He advertised that he
would like some European and German stamps; so I bought some
stamps, and sent him some Baden stamps. He had them several days
in his possession, and he could find out if they were good ones
or not. Mr. Hilckes, his manager, said that they were good ones,
and put them away at once. There is another case where the dealer
thought them good ones. Why should I not have bought them for
good ones, only being a collector? I only sold four Baden stamps
at first, but five or six days afterwards, when I offered him
some more &#150; twenty four, I think &#150; he bought the whole
lot. He had this lot about the 14th, and he sends a cheque on the
21st. It was nearly a week later. Therefore, he had quite time
enough to examine the stamps thoroughly. If he has taken them at
first for good ones as well as I &#150; if he did not examine
them afterwards, before he paid the money to me, that is not my
fault. Then he never wrote to me up to date that his Baden stamps
were bad ones; and the first word I heard about it was at the
Police-court. He never wrote one word to me and complained about
his Baden stamps. He even asked me for more. I had no more. And I
wrote him saying I had no more, but I was sorry, and should try
to get some more. But afterwards he did not complain even. He
asked me for more Baden stamps, and I tried to get more, and
therefore there are more Baden stamps in my possession. I bought
and exchanged them afterwards, and, therefore, I had them. I was
induced, by Mr. Bright writing and asking for more, to buy other
Baden stamps. If he had written plainly to me, &#147;We have
found out that these Baden stamps are bad ones,&#148; and had
informed me as he ought to have done, then certainly I should
have written to him and said, &#147;Well, I shall try to give you
the money back, and I shall try to get the stamps hack.&#148; I
should never have tried to acquire other Baden stamps only that
he induced me to spend more money about it &#150; about things
which he knew were not good ones. He sent some of those stamps
away also to his collectors, and in some cases he had them back,
and brought them to Mr. Phillips. Nothing is positively proved
that they are the same Baden stamps; but if they are, and if they
are bad ones, nobody can find fault with me ; because, if dealers
did not find out they were not good ones, why should I? Then
there is a very peculiar thing with Mr. Bright. I wrote to him,
telling him I had a large collection on sale on commission for
one of my friends on the Continent &#150; a business man who came
to be the head of a large manufacturing firm by the death of his
father, and he had an old collection. He wanted to sell that
collection; and as London is a very good place for selling
stamps, he asked me if I could find a customer. So I wrote to Mr.
Bright, because I did not want anything to do with London
dealers. I know there is a permanent rivalry and jealousy, and
they do not like anybody else to be in the business, and regard
everybody as an intruder. I would not have anything to do with
them, and I wrote to Mr. Bright asking him if he was prepared to
invest about £2,000 in a large collection. He said, in answer to
my letter, &#147;Yes ; we are prepared to invest this £2,000,
not alone, but even more if necessary.&#148; He wanted to know
the particulars, and I wrote him all the particulars. Then
afterwards I went specially to Bournemouth for this purpose, and
we talked the matter over. When I came to Bournemouth and saw Mr.
Bright, Mr. Bright told this to me: &#147;Well, we would like to
buy the collection, but we cannot spend the whole amount at once
for stamps. If the owner would like to take one part in cash, and
the other part in bills payable by instalments, we should like to
buy the collection.&#148; I said the intention of the owner was
to sell the collection only for ready cash ; but I shall try if I
can make arrangements, and put you in communication with him. So
I left Bournemouth, but afterwards the matter was stopped. I did
not get any answer, because I was arrested in the meantime.</p>

<p>Then, gentlemen, there is one other thing. It has been said to
you that I sold this stamp under my Christian name of
&#147;Bernard,&#148; and wrote the letter also in that name. So
when I saw the advertisement of Mr. Bright I did it in the same
way, and signed the letter &#147;Bernard.&#148; But afterwards,
when the transaction with the collection was coming on, and I had
an appointment with these people, and might even have to go over
to the Continent for making the arrangement, then I took my other
name, &#147;Assmus;&#148; but I wrote to them that I was a
journalist and correspondent, and that is true, as I can prove.
That is my profession today, but I have had a lot of misfortune,
as I told you.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, the question is here &#150; Has it been proved
that I had the intention to commit a fraud or not? Every fraud
must be made knowingly. It must be proved, therefore, that I had
known before that the stamps were bad ones. I did not know it at
all. As to the &#147;V.R.&#148; stamp which I showed to Mr. Buhl,
he said to me, &#147;My opinion is that the stamp has been
altered ; but if you do not believe me you can go and ask some
other people.&#148; I showed the stamp to other people, and they
said, &#147;We think it is a good one.&#148; Nobody knew anything
about it, therefore. I offered it to Mr. Giwelb, and he thought
it was a good one,</p>

<p>I got it in exchange from an old gentleman who had a
collection, and had no reason to believe it a bad one. I offered
it to Giwelb, and he took it. I had it back afterwards, and there
was no reason of false pretence at all with Giwelb. It can be
seen that the matter was treated more as a debt between us,
because he returned the stamp to me, and, therefore, he is not
the man who ought to come forward here and commit perjury &#150;
he is not the man who would part willingly with some evidence he
had in his hand against me.</p>

<p>Then, gentlemen, there is the Indian stamp. I had no idea at
all that that was a bad stamp &#150; that something had been
changed. Mr. Phillips bought the stamp, and he thought it was a
good one. I thought it was a good one. There were two Indian
stamps found upon me. I bought them afterwards, because I thought
they were all good ones. The one I bought and sold was a good
one, and if you had good ones once, would you not buy them at the
same place again? The other dealers also give a guarantee that
their stamps are genuine ones; and, if they guarantee that stamps
are genuine ones, they ought to have sufficient knowledge to know
if a stamp is a good one or not; and if they have not knowledge
enough they ought not to pretend it in their advertisements in
the paper, because if they do they are imposing on the public. If
they say they guarantee the stamps, that means that they can find
out whether a stamp is a good one or a bad one ; and, if they can
find that out, they ought to have found out whether the stamps I
sold were bad ones or not. Therefore, they cannot find fault with
me. I think I have shown now sufficiently that I had no intention
to defraud anybody. I bought the stamps. I bought them cheap, and
tried to sell them at a profit. I bought some of them in the
street, as is usual, in the Copthall-avenue. I think I have said
all I can. If I had been at liberty I could have brought a lot of
people here, perhaps; but that has been impossible. I repeat that
I had no intention to defraud anybody.</p>

<p>SUMMING UP.</p>

<p>The COMMON SERJEANT : Gentlemen, I will state to you the
charge against the prisoner, and the law applicable to the case.
He is charged as Bernard Assmus. He has passed as Dr. Bernard,
but he said just now that that was his Christian name. In the
rent book, which has been produced, the name &#147;Assmus&#148;
is the one that always occurs. The charge against the prisoner is
for obtaining money by false pretences. Gentlemen, that offence
consists of four elements. First of all there must be a pretence
; secondly, that pretence must be false to the knowledge of the
person making it at the time he makes it ; thirdly, the money
must be obtained thereby, or it must, at least, have exercised a
substantial influence on the mind of the person parting with the
money to part with it ; and, fourthly, there is the point which
the prisoner has insisted on so much,<br
style="box-sizing: border-box;">
and which is the crucial point in the case, namely, that there
must be intent to defraud. He took that up in the first instance,
when he made his defence at the Police-court, because he said
there, &#147;I never intended to defraud Mr. Reya or Mr. Giwelb.
If the stamps are forgeries, I bought and sold them without
knowing they were forgeries, and I was deceived in the same way
as Mr. Reya ; and why should I not he deceived if those gentlemen
of large experience were deceived?&#148; That, substantially, is
what he has been saying today. Gentlemen, with regard to that,
unfortunately for him a great number of stamps were found at the
prisoner&#146;s rooms, where he lived, which are given in
evidence to show that there was falsity throughout this matter,
and there was intent to defraud. It has been proved before you
that there were eight hundred forged postage stamps among the
four thousand found. That has been sworn to. There was also
muriatic acid, and sulphuric acid, and colours, and dies, and
some specimens of nearly all the stamps mentioned in the
indictment. Of course those are all matters for you, and the
question whether there was an intent to defraud or not is
entirely for you. The prisoner seems to have put himself very
much in the position of a person who is dealing in the ordinary
way, and he says with regard to the people who purchased these
stamps that it is a case of caveat emptor, and if some of these
people were imposed upon, why should not he be? That is really
the case for the defence.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, I must say a word with regard to what is a
pretence. A pretence is a representation of an existing fact
which, at the time of the pretence being made, was not a fact
&#150; a representation with regard to a future matter is not
enough. It may be in writing, or it may be by conduct, and here
the allegation would be that it was conduct. There is a
well-known case in which an undergraduate at Oxford went into a
shop and purchased some boots, and did not pay for them. He was
indicted for obtaining the boots by false pretences, and it was
held to be a sufficient pretence that he wore an
undergraduate&#146;s gown when he was not entitled to wear it.
Now what is stated to have been held out here to be true is that
these stamps were genuine. That runs all through this indictment
&#150; that the representation was that the stamps were genuine
at a time when they really were not, and he knew they were not.
That is the charge. As to the money being obtained where he is
charged with having obtained it, there is no doubt whatever.
There are two cases where there were only attempts, and in those
cases the prosecution can only prove the attempts. So that there
is, I think, ample evidence to go to you with regard to the first
three points. First, that there was a pretence ; secondly, that
the prisoner knew it was false when he made it; and, thirdly,
that he obtained the money thereby.</p>

<p>The real question you have to decide is the one which he has
addressed you upon, namely, Was there an intent to defraud?
Certainly he has defended himself with singular ability, being a
foreigner, and having to address you in a tongue with which he is
not so familiar as he is with his own language. From the first to
the last he has said, I did not intend to defraud.&#148; Whether
he did intend to defraud or not it is for you to say. If you
think he did, and the other points are made out to your
satisfaction, you will say he is guilty. If you think there is
any doubt you will give him the benefit of that, and return a
verdict of acquittal.</p>

<p>The jury retired to consider their verdict, and returned into
Court in a few minutes.]</p>

<p>VERDICT</p>

<p>The ASSOCIATE: Gentlemen, have you agreed upon your verdict ? <br>
The FOREMAN : We have. <br>
The ASSOCIATE : Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty ? <br>
The FOREMAN : Guilty.</p>

<p>Detective-Serjeant PENSON, recalled.</p>

<p>The COMMON SERJEANT : Is there anything known about the
prisoner, Sergeant Penson?<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">
A. I have made some inquiries, my Lord, regarding the prisoner.
During the year 1891 we had complaints of two other cases against
the prisoner ; but the gentleman in the one case is at present at
Bournemouth, and very ill. The other case was one of an elderly
lady who did not wish to appear at the Police-court, but
communicated with us about the matter. The prisoner has been in
London four or five years, during which time he was in possession
of about £1,200, which was money belonging to his wife, which he
invested. The money was lost through bad speculation. His wife
afterwards left him, in consequence of his living with other
women. When I went to his place at Church-street I found he was
in a state of great destitution. The place was quite barren, and
there was not any food in the home. The prosecutor, in the first
place, supplied the woman with whom he has been living with food.
The prisoner was, about eighteen months ago, made bankrupt for
the sum of £250.</p>

<p>The COMMON SERJEANT : I want to ask you a question about the
stamps. You found an enormous number of stamps on the premises?</p>

<p>A. 800 forged. About 4,000 were found altogether. A number of
them were altered.</p>

<p>The COMMON SERJEANT : It is a very serious matter. It is the
first case of the kind I have tried. It is a question of first
impression. There seems to have been a very large trade carried
on in stamps by persons in the position of Mr. Bright and Mr.
Phillips&#146; Company. This is a Treasury prosecution, Mr. Gill?</p>

<p>Mr.ARTHUR GILL: Yes, my Lord. All the facts are in your
Lordship&#146;s possession as far as we know.</p>

<p>The COMMON SERJEANT: What view do the authorities take of the
case?</p>

<p>mr.ARTHUR GILL : We have not any information on that subject.</p>

<p>The COMMON SERJEANT : It is an offence against the public.</p>

<p>SERGEANT PENSON : It was started, my Lord, in the first
instance, by the prosecutor, Mr. Giwelb, but it was put in the
hands of the Treasury because we thought we should require legal
aid and assistance.</p>

<p>Mr.LEVER, [who in the course of the afternoon had been
instructed on behalf of the prisoner for the purpose of rendering
him legal assistance, although, not being fully informed of the
facts, leaving the prisoner to continue his own defence] said :
Might I ask this witness, my Lord, one or two questions on behalf
of the prisoner?</p>

<p>The COMMON SERJEANT : Yes.</p>

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. LEVER.<br
style="box-sizing: border-box;">
Q. You say 4,000 stamps were found on the premises, and 800 on
the prisoner?<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">
A. Yes.</p>

<p>Q. And of those 800 were forged? <br>
A. Yes.</p>

<p>Q. There were signs that the prisoner carried on, besides this
fraudulent business, a legitimate stamp business? The possession
of 4,000 genuine stamps would lead you to suppose the prisoner
carried on a legitimate business besides the fraudulent business
on which he has been committed?<br
style="box-sizing: border-box;">
A. I have not heard of any legitimate business. All the cases I
have heard of are frauds.</p>

<p>Q. Did you not find any such indication by their being genuine
stamps?<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">
A. Those stamps that were genuine were very common &#150; mere
waste paper.</p>

<p>Mr.ARTHUR GILL : I am informed by Major Evans, my Lord, that
within the last four or five years a very large number of forged
stamps have been placed on the market, and people have been
defrauded in purchasing them ; and there are prosecutions pending
against other prisoners.</p>

<p>The COMMON SERJEANT : I have nothing to do with that.</p>

<p>Mr.ARTHUR GILL: We have no reason to suppose that the prisoner
is in any way connected with them.</p>

<p>Mr.LEVER : In sentencing the prisoner, I hope your lordship
will not lose sight of the fact that this is the first instance
of any prosecution for this class of crime having been undertaken
by the Treasury or any other party. It has been the custom of
other judges, and of your lordship also, in cases of this kind
not to pass a severe sentence for a first offence. There has been
no previous prosecution for this class of crime. It is evident,
from the evidence which has been brought before your lordship,
that there has been a certain amount of looseness among the trade
in stamps, and it might very well be that a temptation of this
kind being offered, would be yielded to more easily on account of
that looseness. I think that is a slight observation which may be
made in the prisoner&#146;s favour. I would also remind your
lordship that there is no previous conviction against the
prisoner. He seems to have been a very unfortunate man, having
originally occupied a good position. He is a man of ability, who
has lost his money through misfortune. He has already been in
prison for ten weeks. I think he was taken into custody on the
21st November last, and has been in custody ever since.</p>

<p>SENTENCE.</p>

<p>The COMMON SERIEANT : I think it is a very serious offence on
the part of the prisoner to deal with the Queen&#146;s effigy in
the way in which he has done.</p>

<p>The prisoner was then sentenced to three years&#146; penal
servitude.</p>
