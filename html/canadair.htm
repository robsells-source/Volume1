<p align="left">From 1918 onwards, several private companies
delivered mail by air between the cities of Montreal and Toronto,
Calgary and Edmonton, and Toronto and Ottawa. In the 1920's more
private companies followed which flew to remote mining towns and
large cities as well. Some of the companies used special labels.
The first official airmail stamp was issued in 1928 when the
Montreal Albany (New York) flight was inaugurated. </p>

<p align="left">I've seen a forged double '= 6 =' overprint. On
the back a black cancel was applied with 'FORGERY', just below it
a red cancel with the words 'ANDRE FRODEL', referring to the
forger <a href="frodel.htm">Andre Frodel.</a> The following
information was passed to me by Ken Pugh concerning the above
forgeries:<br>
<em>&quot;Frodel never worked with overprints. There is quite a
story to&nbsp;these.&nbsp;Fred Eaton, a prominent Vancouver
dealer and benefactor to Frodel,&nbsp;was in possession of the
Frodel estate (including a stock of his forgeries) when the
Vancouver Police was investigation Frodel's forgery activities.
To avoid a problem, he backstamped the Frodel forgeries in his
possession FORGERY or FAKE&nbsp; ANDRE FRODEL. As Eaton, has in
his possession other forgeries from other makers (also his
friends) he backstamped those two. These included many
overprints, OHMS and G officials, even some perfins. The maker of
these &quot;Frodels&quot; was probably Alex MacMaster, a
Vancouver printer and friend of Eaton. I suspect
&quot;Frodels&quot; are being backstamped to this day to satisfy
the forgery collector market.&quot;</em></p>
