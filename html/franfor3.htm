Ceres type, click here</a>, or <a href="frasper1.htm">here for
Sperati forgeries</a>.</p>

<p align="left">The tete-beche stamps have also been forged, for
example the forger <a href="fournier1.htm">Fournier</a> is known
to have made forgeries. </p>

<p align="left">I've also seen a pair of genuine 20 c stamps,
where in one of the stamps, the head of Ceres and the
inscriptions had been cut out and pasted upside down, in order to
pretent to be a rare tete-beche variety. </p>

<p align="left">I have also seen a <a href="winter14.htm">Peter
Winter</a> tete-beche forgery of the 10c red(!), 15 c orange!),
40 c orange and 40 c red(!):</p>

(Other Winter products block of 4 stamps with one inverted stamp,
note the 'BEAUNE 3e 5 MARS (26)' cancel which seems to have been
used often by Winter). I've seen several forged 15 c green Ceres
stamps with the same cancel (also in a pair of two stamps).</p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/franfor131.jpg" width="309"

A 5 F Napoleon stamp with exactly the same cancel of Beaune</p>

<p align="left">Winter also sold his forgeries normally:</p>

(A 10 c orange (!) and a 15 c red(!) Winter forgery, I have also
seen a 10 c red)</p>

height="227"> <a href="franc2/francPeterWinter2.jpg"><img
src="franc2/francPeterWinter2.jpg" border="0" width="454"
height="535"></a><br>
These forgeries have the cancel &quot;LE LAC-OR.....1E/1
SEPT&quot;, (the rest becomes very blotchy and I cannot deceipher
it), I have also seen a bloc of four forgeries, where 1 stamp was
printed tete-beche with exactly the same cancel.</p>

<p>This forgery was also made by <a href="winter.htm">Peter
Winter</a> (for more information see:
http://www.sheryll.net/Forgeries/Ugly_Sellers/Forgeries_article_Ugly_Sellers.htm).
The same &quot;LE LAC-OR...&quot; cancel can be found on one of
his 5 F Napoleon issue forgeries.</p>

Tete beche forgeries of the 1 F value. Parts of the background
pattern are missing. Most likely Peter Winter products as well.
Note that the inscription &quot;POSTES&quot; is too small and the
badly done side ornaments.</p>

Primitive 1 F forgery.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/lyon1938rep.jpg" width="698"
height="870"><br>
Mini sheet made in 1938 with a 20 c black reprint for the 'FOIRE
de LYON'; the stamp is cancelled 'LYON 1 JANV 49 (68)'</p>

<p align="left">Another 'reprint' of the 20 c black was made for
the 'Salon der Philatelie' in Hamburg (Germany) in 1984. The
stamp is 1.25 times too large (the inscription on the back reads
'Maﬂstab 1: 1,25'. It is printed singly on a minisheet with a
wavy 'watermark' and with 'Reproduktion 1984' printed at the
bottom of the stamp. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/franfour14.jpg"><img
src="franc2/franfour14.jpg" border="0" width="417" height="249"></a><br>
I've often seen the above pair of 20 c forgeries with cancel
'LILLE 12 JANV. 1849' (always in the same position). I've also
seen single stamps cut from the above pair. These are modern
forgeries.</p>

<h4 align="left">Postal forgeries of the 1870 issue</h4>

<p align="left">Two different kinds of postal forgeries are known
to have been used in Marseilles. Used postal forgeries always
have the cancel '2240' of Marseilles.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/marseillefor1.jpg" width="249"
height="303"><br>
Reduced sizes, 'Marseille' forgery</p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/marseillefor1d.jpg"><img

src="franc2/FauxdePons2002.jpg" border="0" width="180"
height="215"></a><br>
Marseilles forgery, 'FAUX DE PONS'</p>

<p align="left">The first postal forgery of Marseilles is also
known as 'FAUX DE PONS'. This forgery is also very poorly
executed. There is a white area in the hair above the grapes,
there are irregular points below the eyes. A white dot in front
of the left '20' touches the line in front of it. A white line
extends to the interior of the left 'C' behind '20'. The rigth
'2' is slanting slightly backwards. </p>

<p align="left">I don't posess an image of the second postal
forgery of Marseille. </p>

<h4 align="left">Forgeries of the 1871 issue:</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="franc/cutperf1.jpg"
alt="Perforations cut!" width="178" height="211"></p>

<p align="left">The above stamp has the perforations cut off, to
make it seem a french colonies issue or a Bordeaux issue.
However, the cancel 'Le Havre' proves that this is not a french
colony issue. The Bordeaux issue differs in many aspects from the
perforated stamps. So the stamp is just a forgery!</p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/asis1.jpg"><img
src="franc2/asis1.jpg" border="0" width="194" height="223"></a><br>
This 2 c stamp differs in design in several aspects from a
genuine 2 c stamp. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/franceforgs51.jpg"
width="1164" height="237"> <a href="franc/ballon1.jpg"><img
src="franc/ballon1.jpg" border="0" width="956" height="298"></a></p>

<p align="left">The above forgeries are overprinted 'B.BALLON
P.E.'; could this be an attempt to imitate a rare cancel (are
these Spiro forgeries?)?</p>

<p align="left">The following picture of a piece of an envelope
was send to me by Christophe Veysseyre. It has a 'BALLON MONTE'
mark, a 'PARIS 5E/29 SEPT 70 R. DE PALESTRO' cancel, a '16' star
cancel and looks very convincing at first sight. However, there
is a 20 c brown stamp on it that was never issued. The two stamps
are forged, compare for example the pearls in the central circle
with a genuine stamp (the pearls in this forgery are too small).
Also the perforation is very rough. Even the envelope is forged;
see the almost identical envelope below with similar stamps on
it. Note that the text at the back (which can be vaguely seen
shining through), is identical to the one on the piece of the
envelope. I've been told that these facsimiles were produced by
Letts (the diary producers) and sold for 6 p. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/cavendish.jpg" width="319"
height="217"><br>
Similar item obtained from a Cavendish auction adressed to 'Mr.
Simpson Hereford Square London S.W.' I've been told that these
envelopes by Letts, a dairy producer and sold for 6 pence.</p>

src="franc2/franasis62.jpg" border="0" width="190" height="218"></a><br>
A Ceres stamp (30 c red?) with a &quot;LONDON PAID&quot; cancel.
I think this could be a cut from a souvenir postcard?</p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/francefacsimile1.jpg"><img
src="franc2/francefacsimile1.jpg" border="0" width="192"
height="235"></a><br>
A facsimile of the 20 c black with red overprint
&quot;Facsimile&quot;. This is actually a forgery distributed
with Tobler Swiss Milk Chocolate somewhere in the 1920's or
1930's. It was part of a set of 12 'Old and new postage stamps'
facsimiles.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/franfor3004.jpg"><img
src="franc2/franfor3004.jpg" border="0" width="194" height="225"></a>
<br>
4 c imperforate forgery. Looks like a cut from some souvenir card
to me. </p>

<h4 align="left">Postal forgery of Oran:</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/fauxdoran.jpg"><img
src="franc2/fauxdoran.jpg" border="0" width="220" height="248"></a>
<br>
I've been told that this is a postal forgery made in Oran
(Algeria; &quot;Faux d'Oran&quot;) of the 25 c blue. The upper
left ornamental greec border starts from the left in this forgery
(in the genuine it starts from the right). The perforation is
very badly done. </p>

I have seen many 'stamps' with 'AA POSTES AA' in the design
resembling the 1849 issue of France, I have seen many colours,
also blocks with tete-beche stamps; I don't know where these
so-called 'vignettes' come from</p>
