<p align="left">J.A.Nutter was a stamp dealer in Montreal. The
famous stamp forger <a href="taylor.htm">S.Allan Taylor</a> lived
in Canada (Montreal) where he got interested in stamps after a
visit to J.A.Nutter. Taylor got into an argument with J.A.Nutter
over bogus Canadian Bancroft locals. J.A.Nutter made an original
design, but didn't like it and ordered a second design. Meanwhile
Taylor produced forgeries of the first design. Probably a dealer
label for J.A.Nutter:</p>

<p align="left">A bogus issue, created by J.A.Nutter:
&quot;BANCROFT'S CITY EXPRESS 43 St. JAMES STRT MONTREAL&quot;:</p>

<p align="left">Note the striking resemblance of the design of
the first forgery (same person) with a USA Whitteley's bogus
issue (see image next to it). This bogus issue was first made by
J.A.Nutter in the design with the man facing to the right (see
also the next bogus stamp). They were subsequently forged <a
href="taylor.htm">by the forger Taylor</a> in the second design.
By the way, J.A.Nutter closely worked with Taylor. <br>
An interesting anecdote about these stamps was given by <font
size="3">Fred J. Melville in Mekeel's Weekly 21 October 1935);
apparently the 'ugly design' was made by Nutter first and then
rejected and replaced by the nicer design. In the meantime,
Taylor had stolen the ugle design and made forgeries from them. </font></p>

<p align="left">In September 1864 Nutter advertises in The Stamp
Collector's Advertiser with:<br>
&quot;<em>AMERICAN LOCALS for sale, by J.A.Nutter, Box 519, P.O.
Montreal, Canada -Unprepaid letters not received</em>.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">In the Stamp-Collector's Magazine of 1865 (page
80) one can read:<br>
'<em>A NEW CANADIAN LOCAL'<br>
To the editor of the 'Stamp-Collector's Magazine.'<br>
Dear Sir,- Mr.Bancroft, the proprietor of the City Express, is
soon to issue a 5 cent stamp for his own use. He had a woodcut
made, but as he was displeased with it he rejected it. Some
person obtained an impression from the rejected block and
counterfeited it, and has put the counterfeits in circulation. I
understand that the genuine Bancroft stamp is to be engraved on
copper and perforated.<br>
Yours very truly,<br>
Montreal <br>
I.A.N</em>.'</p>

<p align="left">I believe the initials 'I.A.N.' must have been
from James A.Nutter (or John Appleton Nutter?). The 'person'
referred to above was <a href="taylor.htm">Taylor</a>. </p>

<p align="left">On page 89 of the same journal (Stamp-Collector's
Magazine, June 1865) an image of the above stamp (with Bancroft
facing to the right) can be found. The text reads:<br>
'<em>Our solitary engraving represents a local stamp for
Montreal. It was alluded to in the correspondence of our number
for April, and its genuine character is confirmed by a letter
received direct from a trustworthy party in its native city. We
confess we cannot understand why the price should be so
comparatively high for a stamp apparently destined for mere local
duty, but suppose Canada continues in the same state of
destitution of local goverment post office, as was formerly the
case in the United States.</em>'</p>

'COLLEGE STAMP. MONTREAL', another Taylor-Nutter product? The
Stamp Collectors Monthly Gazette (Vol.1, no 1, p. 2) writes
&quot;<em>The so-called College Stamp, B.S.&amp; Co., blue rect,
is ficitious. It was issued by an enterprising dealer in Montreal
and made to sell only</em>&quot;. This dealer was probably
S.Allan Taylor or J.A.Nutter. </p>
