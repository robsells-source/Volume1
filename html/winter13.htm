<p align="left">The forger Peter Winter (Germany) made forgeries
of many classic and rare stamp of several countries in the
1980's. They sometimes have the word 'replik' written on the
backside (but not always). He not only sold them 'loose' but also
on cover. He seems to have used some photographs of the British
Library in London to make some of his forgeries (source:
http://www.sheryll.net/Forgeries/Germany/Forgeries_article_Germany.htm).
A catalog exists of the 'House of Stamps', offering his 'stamps',
see:
http://www.seymourfamily.com/billclaghorn/HouseOfStamps/index.htm.
Recently, these forgeries are offered in large numbers on
internet auctions for low prices.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Note on all Winter forgeries:They are
printed on modern paper (the paper doesn't 'look' old). This is
the main distinghuishing characteristic.</strong></p>

<p align="left">BAVARIA:</p>

<p align="left">Peter Winter also made forgeries of the 1 k stamp
1849 stamps of Bavaria, examples:</p>

(Peter Winter forgeries, reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">I have seen these Peter Winter forgeries with
printed normally and with blurred print (see picture above). I
have seen them often with the '107' wheel-cancel. I've also seen
some Winter forgeries of the 1 k black value with a wheel-cancel
'49'. These forgeries were made in the 1980's, they don't look
very 'old'.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat/bavforg1.jpg" width="393"

(Reduced size)</p>

<p align="left">A similar letter with four 18 kr forgeries and
the same cancel 'DEGGENDORF 23 5' and numeral cancel '49' can be
found at Bill Claghorn's website:
http://members.tripod.com/claghorn1p/Bavaria/Front1.htm.
Everything seems to be forged, even the letter itself. </p>

Block of four 18 k stamps with cancel 'PASSAU 18/9 5 A BAHNHOF'</p>

<p align="left">In the 'House of Stamps' catalogue, a row of four
18 k stamps can be found, cancelled with a '356' cancel and a
'Zwischensteg' in the middle. Winter also seems to have made
forgeries of the 18 k yellow stamps, though I have not seen them
personally. </p>

<p align="left">I have indications that Peter Winter also made
several 'proofs' in colors different than the issued colors of
the first issues. </p>

<p align="left">The next envelope is completely forged, it is
adressed to 'Landwirtschaftliche Verein ???? Sauschwabenheim bei
Engelheim' (the text is difficult to read):</p>

<p>Note that this same forged envelope was also used for a Baden
Stockach issue (imperforate 3 k stamp).</p>
