<h4 align="left">Hamburg is a Free City of the Hansa in the north
of Germany. Besides the official issues for <a
href="gstatham.htm">Hamburg</a> there also exists numerous local
issues.</h4>

<h1 align="center">The so called 'Hamburger Boten' institute
issues:</h1>

<p>Issued by C.Hamer, H. Scheerenbeck, W. Krantz, Th. Lafrentz
and Ch. van Diemen. Most of these stamps were only issued for
stamp collectors. Forgeries have been made in large quantities of
these stamps, I am not sure if the stamps shown here are genuine.
Probably most of them are forgeries!</p>

<h1 align="center">H. Scheerenbeck </h1>

<h4 align="left">1862 Messenger, inscription 'INSTITUT HAMBURGER
BOTEN H.SCHEERENBECK'</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa2/boten1.jpg" width="214"
height="232"><br>
Possibly genuine stamp.</p>
<div align="left">

<pre>  (1 Sch) black on coloured paper</pre>
</div>

<p align="left">These stamps were reprinted and six kinds of
forgeries exist. </p>

<p align="left">Genuine stamps have two six-rayed stars; one
before and one after the word 'HAMBURGER'. The messenger carries
a letter, this letter points towards the 'S' of 'SCHEERENBECK'.
There is a small line in the bottom of the 'B' of 'BOTEN'.</p>

<h4 align="left">Reprints</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="germa/scheer1.jpg"><img
src="germa/scheer1.jpg" border="0" width="177" height="210"></a> <br>
(Reprint)</p>

<p align="left">Reprints resemble the original stamps, with very
minor modifications. Reprints exist in three types: <br>
a) There is a line through the 'OT' of 'BOTEN'<br>
b) As in a), but an additional line goes from the 'H' of
'HAMBURGER' to the first 'E' of 'SCHEERENBECK'<br>
c) As in b), but with an additional line towards the center
through the 'U' of 'HAMBURGER'. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa4/boten16.jpg" width="183"
height="211"><br>
Looks like a genuine stamp or reprint, but with no stars before
and after 'HAMBURGER'</p>

<h4 align="left">First forgery made by Spiro</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="germa5/scheer2b.jpg"><img
src="germa5/scheer2b.jpg"
alt="&quot;Postman&quot; black on lilac" border="0" width="188"
height="203"></a></p>

<p align="left">This forgery does not have the two stars before
and after the word 'HAMBURGER'. from the genuine stamp. Instead,
only a hyphen can be found behind the word 'HAMBURGER'. The hand
of the messenger does not cary any letter (it should in the
genuine stamps). I've seen the Spiro forgeries in the colours:
black, black on grey, black on yellow (shades), black on green
(shades), black on blue, black on lilac and black on violet
(shades). As with most Spiro products, they were printed in
sheets of 25 (5x5).</p>

<h4 align="left">Second forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="germa/scheer1b.jpg"><img
src="germa/scheer1b.jpg" border="0" width="184" height="213"></a></p>

<p align="left">This forgery has a misshapen 'S' in 'INSTITUT',
it resembles more an '8'. The letter of the carrier is pointed
too low (it should point towards the 'S' of 'SCHEERENBECK'). I
have seen the following colours: black on yellow (shades), black
on blue (shades), black on grey, black on brown, black on green
and black on lilac. Some 'errors' seem to exist: printed on the
wrong side of the stamp (gumside) and inverted stamps (mirror
image). </p>

<h4 align="left">Third forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="germa5/for3_jamiel_stevens.jpg"><img
src="germa5/for3_jamiel_stevens.jpg" border="0" width="184"

Image obtained from Jamiel Stevens.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/scheerfor4.jpg" width="332"
height="129"><br>
(reduced size)</p>

<p align="left">This forgery has a very thick left leg of the 'U'
of 'HAMBURGER'. The oval is more pointed below the 'B' of
'HAMBURGER'. I have seen the following colours: black on grey
(shades), black on green and black on yellow.</p>

<h4 align="left">Fourth forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/scheerfor5.jpg" width="222"
height="132"><br>
(Reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">This forgery was only printed in colours (not in
black as the genuine!) or colour on colour (see pictures above).</p>

<h4 align="left">Sixth forgery made by <a href="scott.htm">Scott</a></h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa5/scheerscott1.jpg" width="184"
height="203"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/scheerfor6.jpg" width="656"
height="120"><br>
(Reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">This forgery has large six-rayed stars in front
and behind 'HAMBURGER'. The 'M' of 'HAMBURGER' is very peculiar.
The 'O' in 'BOTEN' is squarish. One foot of the messenger has a
strange bottom part. These forgeries were printed in black on
colour, but also in colour on white paper. </p>

<p align="left">Scott made album pages of Hamburg, it has ten
empty spaces for this issue. On the empty spaces the following
colors are mentioned 'violet', 'green', 'rose', 'mauve', 'blue',
'yellow', 'orange', 'flesh', 'buff' and 'dark blue'. Such a page
was send to me by Peter Brinkman (Australia).</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="left">1862 Value, inscription 'G. VEREINIGTE
CORPORATIONEN INSTITUT HAMBURGER BOTEN H. SCHEERENBECK'</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/scheertyp2.jpg" width="201"
height="122"> <img src="germa3/scheertyp1.jpg" width="207"
height="128"> <br>
(Two types of the genuine stamps, reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="center"><a href="germa5/scheer_maybe_gen.jpg"><img

height="213"></a> <a href="germa5/scheer1.jpg"><img
src="germa5/scheer1.jpg" border="0" width="171" height="213"></a><br>
Most likely genuine</p>
<div align="left">

<pre>  1/2 Sch black on coloured paper
  1 Sch black on coloured paper</pre>
</div>

<p align="left">Both values exist in two types (having minor
differences), the two types exists printed together on one sheet.
I have seen the colours black on yellow, black on grey, black on
green and black on blue. These stamps were also reprinted and
five(?) kinds of forgeries exist.</p>

<p align="left">Characteristics of the genuine stamps: There is a
dot behind the '1/2' (in the 1/2 Sch) or '1' (in the 1 Sch). This
dot is situated next to the letters 'OT' of 'BOTEN' and not next
to the 'TE' or 'EN'. All stamps issued in colour on white paper
are forgeries. There is a small rather crude cross before the
word 'CORPORATIONEN'. </p>

<h4 align="left">Reprints</h4>

<p align="left">Reprints exist, they show many signs of worn out
printing stones. </p>

<h4 align="left">First forgery (made by <a href="spiro.htm">Spiro</a>)</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa/scheer5.jpg" width="175"
height="219"> <img src="germa2/hamsche3.jpg" width="177"
height="209"></p>

<p align="left">In the forgeries made by Spiro, there is a dot
behind the word 'CORPORATIONEN' (not present in the genuine
stamps). There should be a cross in front of this word, which is
absent in the Spiro forgeries. The 1/2 Sch value does not have a
dot behind the '1/2'.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat3/hambscheeren2.jpg" width="763"
height="1600"><br>
Sheets of the 1 and 1/2 Sch Spiro forgeries; they were apparently
printed together. </p>

<h4 align="left">Second forgery made by <a href="scott.htm">Scott</a>
(the same one from the catalogue!)</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa5/hamscott2.jpg" width="174"
height="199"> <a href="germa2/scheer1.jpg"><img
src="germa2/scheer1.jpg" border="0" width="361" height="218"></a>
<img src="germa5/scheerenbeck1.jpg" width="167" height="206"> </p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/scheerscott1.jpg" width="294"
height="118"><br>
(1/2 Sch reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">1/2 Sch:<br>
The oval is pointed at the top. The dot behind the '1/2' is
placed on the same level as the 'E' of 'BOTEN' (should be the 'O'
of this word).</p>

<p align="left">1 Sch: <br>
The inscription reads 'CORPORATIONER' with a final 'R' instead of
a 'N'. There is nothing in front of the word 'HAMBURGER'.</p>

<p align="left">I have seen both values in the non-existing
colour red. </p>

<p align="left">Scott made album pages of Hamburg, it has twenty
(10 for the 1/2 sch and 10 for the 1 sch) empty spaces for this
issue. Two of the empty spaces has the above forgeries printed in
black (with the above distinguishing characteristics). Such a
page was send to me by Peter Brinkman (Australia).</p>

<h4 align="left">Third forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa2/scheer2.jpg" width="192"
height="220"> <a href="germa2/scheer6.jpg"><img
src="germa2/scheer6.jpg" border="0" width="182" height="229"></a>
</p>

<p align="left">The second 'N' of 'CORPORATIONEN' is placed more
over the 'B' of 'BECK' in this forgery, in the genuine stamps the
'N' is placed between the 'N' and 'B' of 'SCHEERENBECK'. The
second 'I' of 'INSTITUT' is very close to the following 'T'. The
dot behind the figure of value is placed next to the 'TE' of
'BOTEN' while it is placed next to the 'OT' of this word in the
genuine stamps. </p>

<h4 align="left">Fourth forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/scheerfor10.jpg" width="452"
height="134"> <img src="germa3/scheerfor11.jpg" width="454"
height="129"><br>
(Reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">These forgeries are very clearly printed. I have
seen both values in the colours black on lilac, black on yellow,
black on green, black on blue, black on grey and black on brown.
The cross in front of 'CORPORATIONEN' consists of four seperate
'balls'. The 'H' in front of 'SCHEERENBECK' is very narrow. The
'O's of the word 'CORPORATIONEN' are too round. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="left">1862 'Tower' or 'Castle' type, large sized
stamps, inscription 'Jnstitut hamburger Boten H.Scheerenbeck'</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="germa4/scheerenbeck.jpg"><img
src="germa4/scheerenbeck.jpg" border="0" width="258" height="266"></a><br>
Probably genuine</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/scheergen1.jpg" width="426"
height="150"><br>
(Genuine stamps, last one with 'n' instead of 'u' in 'Institnt')</p>
<div align="left">

<pre>  (1 Sch) black on coloured paper</pre>
</div>

<p align="left">Misprints exist with the 'u' of 'Jnstitut'
inverted becoming 'Jnstitnt'. I have seen the colours black on
yellow, black on orange, black on green, black on blue and black
on lilac (violet). Specialist distinghuish between first and
second printings (with a retouched 'u' of 'Jnstitut' where the
erroneous 'n' used to be).</p>

<p align="left">Reprints of these stamps exist, aswell as eight
different kinds of forgeries. I've only managed to get
information on seven of them.</p>

<p align="left">In the genuine stamps, one of the 39 points
forming the central ellipse touches the 'b' of 'Scheerenbeck'.
The stars should have 8 rays. The word 'Boten' does NOT have a
stop behind it. The 't' of this word has a straight foot. The
word 'Jnstitut' is written with a 'J'. </p>

<h4 align="left">Official reprint-forgery made by Krantz</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="germa5/scheerrepr.jpg"><img
src="germa5/scheerrepr.jpg" border="0" width="254" height="271"></a><br>
A reprint-forgery</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/scheerkrantz.jpg" width="274"
height="144"><br>
(Reprint-forgery made by Krantz, reduced size)</p>

<p align="left">When Krantz took over the Boten institute, he
wanted to make reprints to sell them to interested stamp
collectors. However, the original stones were destroyed, thus he
decided to make new ones. The official reprint-forgeries differ
considerably in design from the genuine stamps. </p>

<p align="left">They can be recognized by the fact that they have
48 long uneven points in the central oval (instead of 39). The
stars are 8-rayed as in the genuine, but their shape is quite
different. The lettering is also differnt from the genuine
stamps. </p>

<p align="left">Due to heavy printing of the stones, several
sub-types can be distinghuished:<br>
a) A scratch joins the 'c' and 'h' of 'Scheerenbeck'.<br>
b) As in a), but with additional stroke through the 'u' of
'Hamburger', also with several scratches around this letter.<br>
c) As in b), but with additional scratch joining the 'J' of
'Jnstitut' to the dot below it. </p>

<h4 align="left">Second forgery made by <a href="spiro.htm">Spiro</a></h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa5/scheer1c.jpg"
alt="&quot;Castle&quot; black on lilac" width="258" height="272">
<img src="germa/scheer4.jpg" width="242" height="245"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa/boten1.jpg" width="183"
height="198"> <img src="germa/boten2.jpg" width="185"
height="199"><br>
(Reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">In these Spiro forgeries, there are only 38
points in the central ellipse (should be 39). There are two very
thick six-rayed stars at both side (should be eight-rayed). I
have seen the following colours of these forgeries: black on
yellow (shades), black on lilac (shades), black on green, black
on blue, black on violet (shades) and black on grey. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat3/hambscheeren1.jpg"
width="1600" height="1087"><br>
A whole sheet of these forgeries. </p>

<h4 align="left">Third forgery, made by <a href="scott.htm">Scott</a></h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa5/hambScott2.jpg" width="241"
height="248"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa2/scheer4.jpg" width="250"
height="171"><br>
(Scott forgery, sorry, only upper part of stamp available)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/scheerscott.jpg" width="391"
height="139"><br>
(Scott forgeries, reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">In this forgery made by Scott, no circular
windows exist in the main tower. The rays forming the central
circle are very sharp. There are 42 of these rays (there should
be 39 only). The star on the right hand side is very 'squeezed'.
I have seen these forgeries in the colours: black on blue, black
on lilac, black on yellow, black on grey, black on brown and the
bogus colours: blue and brown.</p>

<p align="left">Scott made album pages of Hamburg, it has ten
empty spaces for this issue. One of them has this forgery printed
in black (with the above distinguishing characteristics). The
other empty spaces indicate the colors: 'dark yellow', 'orange',
'buff', 'mauve', 'green', 'pink', 'rose', 'blue' and 'dark blue'.
Such a page was send to me by Peter Brinkman (Australia).</p>

<h4 align="left">Fourth forgery</h4>

<p align="center">(Sorry, no picture available yet)</p>

<p align="left">This forgery has the inscription'Institut', the
genuine stamps have inscription 'Jnstitut' with a 'J'. The stars
have six rays instead of eight. </p>

<h4 align="left">Fifth forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat3/botensch1d.jpg" width="299"
height="298"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/botensch1.jpg" width="355"
height="188"><br>
(Reduced size)</p>

<p align="left">In this forgery the inscription 'Jnstitut
Hamburger Boten' is placed too high. I have seen this forgery in
the colours: black on lilac, black on yellow, black on blue,
black on grey, black on brown and black on green.</p>

<h4 align="left">Sixth forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/scheerfor2.jpg" width="283"
height="153"><br>
(Reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">This forgery has the inscription 'H.
Scheerer.beck'. There are 44 points in the central ellipse
(instead of 39 as in the genuine). This is the only forgery I
have seen with a cancel consisting of concentric circles. I have
seen this forgery in the colours: black on grey, black on yellow
(shades), black on lilac and black on blue. </p>

<h4 align="left">Seventh forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="germa3/scheerfor3.jpg"><img
src="germa3/scheerfor3.jpg" border="0" width="245" height="250"></a><br>
(Picture taken from a photocopy, original colour: black on light
blue)</p>

<p align="left">This seems to be a more modern American forgery.
There are two six-pointed stars in this forgery. These points are
very sharp. The foreground in front of the tower should have
horizontal and vertical lines, however, this forgery only has
horizontal lines. There is a stop behind 'Boten' (not present in
the genuine stamps). </p>
