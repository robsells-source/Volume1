<hr>

<p>Nova Scotia issued its own stamps from 1851 until 1867. Now a
province of <a href="canad.htm">Canada</a>. I have tried to
describe the forgeries as accurate as possible, but some
questions remain unanswered about some of them, especially
concerning the Oneglia forgeries of the 1860 issue.</p>

<h4>Reprint:</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="canad2/novarep3.jpg"><img
src="canad2/novarep3.jpg" border="0" width="230" height="231"></a></p>

<p>The paper of the originals is bluish, the reprints have white
paper (made in 1890). They were made in 1890 on the authority of
Mr.Haggert, the Postmaster General of Canada (5 sheets were
printed). </p>

<h4>Forgeries:</h4>

<p>Four different kinds of forgeries exist. Forgers that made
forgeries of the 1 p stamp are Spiro, Moens, Fournier and another
forger (most likely this would have been<a href="oneglia1.htm">Oneglia</a>
or <a href="panelli.htm">Panelli</a>). Most of them seem to have
had difficulties in correctly reproducing the head of the Queen.
Moens made a black and white reproduction and the Spiro forgery
seems to be very crude. Source: 'Nova Scotia Fakes &amp;
Forgeries' by Captain R.B.Mitchell</p>

<p>Example of a Fournier forgery:</p>

height="233"></p>

<p align="left">The above stamps are said to be <a
href="fournier1.htm">Fournier</a> forgeries, the head of the
Queen is quite different compared to a genuine stamp. They often
bear strange cancels, such as &quot;<a href="correosfor.htm">CORREOS
7.1.60. II-III</a>&quot; in a circle, but other cancels exist,
such as the Papal States grill and a <a href="forg1602can.htm">&quot;1602&quot;
cancel</a>. They are not included in his 1914 pricelist and also
do not appear in 'The Fournier album of philatelic forgeries'.
Note the position of the corners of the square surrounding the
Queen's head compared to the genuine stamp. This forgery is also
described in Album Weeds (the only forgery given in this book).</p>

<h4>Cancels</h4>

<p>The most common cancel appears to be an ellipse filled with
horizontal lines. Other cancels are a large numeral, for example
a red '10' or a black '3' or '5'. Also a British style 'A91',
'A93', 'A95', 'A97' and 'A98' exist (these are mailboat cancels).
<br>
More info:
http://www.frmfoundation.org/NovaScotia/period2/images/ns0205.pdf.
</p>

<h4>Bisected stamps, etc.:</h4>

<p>I've seen a bisected 3 p stamp, together with two 3 p stamps
(together 7 1/2 p) on an envelope to Scotland. This was
apparently authorized by the postmaster Woodgate in October 1854
and the only authorized bisection (however, other bisects were
accepted but not official, see
http://www.frmfoundation.org/NovaScotia/period2/images/ns0201.pdf).
I've also seen a bisected 3 p stamp, together with a 6 p stamp on
a letter to England. </p>

<p>These stamps were also cut into 4 pieces on letters (3 p as
3/4 p, 6 p as 1 1/2 p). Forgeries exist of these quartered
bisects (for example Raoul de Thuin made forgeries on letter with
a non-existing cancel 'CREPUSFUND' see 'The Yucatan Affair, The
work of Raoul Ch. de Thuin, Philatelic Counterfeiter', published
by The American Philatelic Society).</p>

<p align="center"><img src="canad2/novscbisforg9.jpg" width="450"
height="307"><br>
Most likely a Raoul de Thuin forgery. The 'Wood Islands' cancel
and the '6' is known to have been forged by him as well as the
elliptic line cancel. Probably the whole envelope was doctered by
him. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="canad2/novscbisforg4.jpg" width="450"
height="267"> <img src="canad2/novscbisforg6.jpg" width="450"
height="273"> <img src="canad2/novscbisforg8.jpg" width="450"
height="287"><br>
Three forged De Thuin covers with bisected stamps, all with a
forged 'HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA' cancel. The cancel is not really
circular, also in the genuine cancel, there is a dot between
'NOVA' and 'SCOTIA' according to the Yucatan Affair book. </p>

<h4>Reprints:</h4>

<p>Reprints exist of all 3 values (made in 1890).</p>

(6 p and 1 Sh reprints)</p>

<p>The paper of the originals is bluish, the reprints have white
paper, the colours are slightly different. They were made in 1890
on the authority of Mr.Haggert, the Postmaster General of Canada
(5 sheets of each value according to:
http://www.frmfoundation.org/NovaScotia/period2/images/ns0204.pdf).

Primitive 3 p forgery, note the squeezed &quot;H&quot; of
&quot;THREE&quot; and the fact that the &quot;P&quot; of
&quot;PENCE&quot; is placed too far to the left (such that it is
right under the center of the ornament above it). Also note the
&quot;CORREOS&quot; cancel on some of the above forgeries. </p>

<p align="left">The above stamps are <a href="spiro.htm">Spiro</a>
forgeries. They can easily be identified by their strange cancels
in general. There are 2 types of the 3 p forgery: in the first
type the crown touches the octogonal around it, in type 2 it
doesn't. <a href="fournier1.htm">Francois Fournier</a> offers 3 p
and 6 p forgeries in his 1914 pricelist, I presume he is offering
these forgeries. Spiro also seems to have made forgeries of the 1
Sh, but I don't have a picture of this forgery. The 6 p has small
lines in the word &quot;SIX PENCE&quot; as in the genuine,
however, these lines are missing in the word &quot;POSTAGE&quot;
(described as second and third forgery of the 6 p in Album Weeds,
in the third forgery the '6's in the corners touch the containing
rectangle).</p>

<p align="center"><img src="canad/novongl1.jpg" width="112"
height="117"><br>
(Characteristic line of the Oneglia forgeries)</p>

<p align="left">I suspect the above stamps to be Oneglia
forgeries. They are engraved as the genuine stamps (and therefore
more difficult to detect). There is a distinct line that can only
be found in these forgeries (see picture above). In the 6 p the
two lines inside the &quot;X&quot; of &quot;SIX&quot; are not
broken (in the genuine stamps one of these lines is interrupted).
These forgeries are mostly cancelled with the shown grid with an
'8' in it (at the right side), but other cancels exist (according
to 'Nova Scotia Fakes &amp; Forgeries' by R.B.Mitchell): a circle
of diameter 25 mm containing 10 , 13 or 14 horizontal bars or a
&quot;N35&quot; cancel. These forgeries often have very large
margins and the engraving is very heavy. <br>
According to the journal BNA Topics (May, 1972 page 116), in an
article called 'The Panellis' by E.A.Smythies, the forged grid
&quot;8&quot; cancel has two unbroken lines besides the
&quot;8&quot;, while the genuine cancel only has one such line.
The genuine cancel '8' belongs to Chatham New Brunswick, it was
also applied by Oneglia/Panelli on forgeries of Nova Scotia and
Newfoundland. </p>

<p align="left">I've been told that the above forgeries are
Fournier forgeries. They look too primitive to have been actually
produced by Fournier, they were probably just sold by him and
made by someone else. As in the last forgery, the flower to the
left of the crown has been replaced by something completely
different (a nut?). I've seen them with several bogus cancels
&quot;1575&quot;, &quot;6080&quot;, &quot;3398&quot;,
&quot;Lagaude&quot;(?), &quot;AFFRACHISSEMENT PARIS&quot;. Note
that in the 1 Sh there are &quot;1&quot;s in the corners (there
should be &quot;12&quot;s). It seems that many colours exist
besides the ones shown here, for example I have seen: 1 Sh green
(see http://members.tripod.com/claghorn1p/NovaScotia/NS06x.htm),
this serie is therefore also called 'Rainbow series' and 1 Sh
yellow:</p>

<p align="left">Album Weeds mentions another dangerous forgery of
the 6 p, where the lines inside the &quot;X&quot; of
&quot;SIX&quot; have the opposite breaks with respect to the
genuine stamps. The unbroken line should go from the left bottom
to the right top. In this forgery the unbroken line goes from the
right bottom to the left top.</p>

<h4 align="left">Type 'A' forgeries:</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="canad2/novfor12.jpg"><img

&quot;FACSIMILE&quot; overprint on a 3 p blue forgery</p>

<p align="left">The above forgery is often referred to as forgery
made by forger 'A' (the identity of this forger is unknown'. The
name 'forger A' was suggested by Nicholas Argenti in his book
'The Postage Stamps of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia'. Often
these forgeries have an overprint 'FAC-SIMILE'. These forgeries
are engraved. The width of the stamp is nearly 24 mm (instead of
23 mm). </p>

<p align="center"><a href="canad2/newbfor12.jpg"><img
src="canad2/newbfor12.jpg" border="0" width="638" height="204"></a><br>

(London Exhibition Sheet)</p>

<p align="left">In 1950 a souvenir sheet was issued in London for
'The London International Stamp Exhibtion'; On this souvenir
sheet there is a 1 Sh Nova Scotia 1852 violet stamp, a Penny
Black, a New South Wales 1 p red 1850, a Ceylon 4 p 1859 and a 4
p Cape triangle of 1853, it was reproduced by the collotype
process and printed by Waterlow &amp; Sons. The Nova Scotia 1 Sh
stamp exists cut out from this sheet and pasted on a 18th century
letter. Furthermore I have seen all the cuts from this sheet
offered as forgeries. </p>

<p align="left">Bisected stamps should be looked upon with the
greatest precaution (many forgeries exist). They exist bisected
or even divided into 4 (the 3 p used as 3/4 p, the 6 p as 1 1/2
p).</p>
