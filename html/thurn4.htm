<h1 align="center">Forgeries</h1>

<p align="left">The Serrane guide mentions some crude forgeries
from Nuremberg etc, besides the more advanced forgeries described
next. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat2/thurfor1.jpg" width="608"

(Fournier forgeries, except probably the 3 k which might be
genuine)</p>

<p align="left">The forger <a href="fournier1.htm">Fournier</a>
seems to have made forgeries of these stamps (kreuzer and
silbgr), I think only black on coloured paper. Another forger (<a
href="oneglia1.htm">Oneglia</a>?, <a href="venturinigb.htm">Venturini</a>?)
printed the forgeries for him in Turin (Italy) on white paper
(source Serrane Guide). Fournier then dyed the paper in the
required color himself. Fournier offered both mint and used
forgeries. In 'The Fournier Album of Philatelic Forgeries' the
following numeral cancels can be found &quot;8&quot; (or actually
more an inverted &quot;6&quot;?), &quot;95&quot;,
&quot;195&quot;, &quot;142&quot; and &quot;34&quot;. I've mostly
seen these forgeries in Fournier Albums. They seem to be not
common at all. The next image shows a page of a Fournier Album
with Thurn and Taxis forgeries: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat3/thurfour1.jpg" width="1275"

Album page with Fournier forgeries and forged cancels taken from
'The Fournier Album of Philatelic Forgeries', they were printed
with a large black margin all around (which was of course cut off
later). The &quot;95&quot; forged cancel (always?) seems to have
a part of the outer circle missing.</p>

<p align="left">I suspect that all values were printed in one
shot. Since the sheet did not fit in the Fournier Album, the 1/4
and 1/3 Sgr values were cut off and pasted below the sheetlet of
the remaining values. </p>

<h4 align="left">The distinguishing characteristics of the
Fournier forgeries are (all of them are quite deceptive, also
note non-consistent background colors or too large margins on
some stamps):</h4>

<p align="left">Since these forgeries were printed individually,
they never show any part of adjacent stamps. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnFournier4001.jpg"><img

height="353"></a> <br>
1/4 Sgr: background pattern slightly different from the genuine
stamps.The bottom right side of the large &quot;4&quot; has a
black blob in this forgery. In my view, the line above
&quot;Silb.&quot; has several consistent weaknesses in this
forgery.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnFournier4002.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnFournier4002.jpg" border="0" width="378"

height="204"></a><br>
1/3 Sgr; part of the bottom left design (just below the right
hand side of the horn) appears to be missing and is just a
straight line. Also a cancelled stamp with a forged
&quot;195&quot; Nastätten cancel.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnFournier4004.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnFournier4004.jpg" border="0" width="343"

src="gstat3/thurnFournier4006.jpg" border="0" width="221"
height="217"></a><br>
1/2 Sgr: The bottom of the final &quot;e&quot; of
&quot;Freimarke&quot; is different. The green color looks a bit
'off' on some of the forgeries. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnFournier4005.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnFournier4005.jpg" border="0" width="344"
height="342"></a><br>
1 Sgr: The &quot;S&quot; of &quot;Silb&quot; has a bottom serif
in the genuine stamps, it is missing in the Fournier forgeries. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnFournier2007.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnFournier2007.jpg" border="0" width="329"

src="gstat3/thurnFournier2009.jpg" border="0" width="206"
height="204"></a><br>
2 Sgr: Some of the lines radiating outwards from the
&quot;2&quot; enter the white space to the right of it. The left
upper posthorn has some weird 'dent' on the left.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnFournier4010.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnFournier4010.jpg" border="0" width="343"
height="308"></a> <br>
3 Sgr: According to the Serrane Guide the pattern in between the
left hand side of the large &quot;3&quot; is not consistent.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnFournier4011.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnFournier4011.jpg" border="0" width="339"

src="gstat3/thurnFournier4019.jpg" border="0" width="208"
height="204"></a> <br>
1 Kr: The bottom right posthorn is split into two parts in my
opinion. Also a cancelled stamp with a forged &quot;195&quot;
Nastätten cancel.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnFournier4012.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnFournier4012.jpg" border="0" width="340"

src="gstat3/thurnFournier4018.jpg" border="0" width="210"
height="205"></a><br>
3 Kr: In the genuine 3 Kr stamp, there is a curved line above the
upper right small &quot;3&quot;, this is missing in the Fournier
forgery. Also a 'finished forgery' with a forged &quot;143&quot;
cancel (Oppenheim).</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnFournier4013.jpg"><img

height="199"></a><br>
6 Kr: The ornaments just right to the upper left small
&quot;6&quot; are different from the genuine stamps.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/thurnFournier4014.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/thurnFournier4014.jpg" border="0" width="354"

height="220"></a><br>
9 Kr: Part of the design is missing under the &quot;er&quot; of
&quot;Kreuzer&quot;. Also a finished forgery with a
&quot;95&quot; (Bensheim) cancel. The &quot;95&quot; forged
cancel (always?) seems to have a part of the outer circle
missing.</p>

<p align="left">As far as I know, Fournier only forged the black
stamps on coloured paper. </p>

Geneva collection of Fournier forgeries, from which some of the
above images were taken. </p>
