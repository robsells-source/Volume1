<hr>

<p>In 1861 eleven southern states of the USA declared themselves
independant (Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Missisippi, Texas, Tennessee and
Virginia). Shortly after the American civil war started. In 1865
the eleven states re-joined the USA again. During this period
stamps for the Confederate States were issued; a general issue
and many local issues.</p>

<p align="left">Large sized forgeries (about twice the size of
the genuine stamps), or 'Facsimile die proofs' as they were
offered were made in 1919 by A.Dietz. These were later used (in
the right size) to make 'Springfield' forgeries. </p>

<p align="left">These forgeries are printed on yellowish paper
and seem to have a mottled appearance. Produced about 1934 by
Tatham's Stamp Company of Springfield, Mass, USA and by H.E.
Macintosh, the owner of the company. The Springfield forgeries
are the most common forgeries. The paper is different from the
genuine issues. Many of these forgeries have the overprint
'Facsimile' on the back (due to complaints), but the first issues
don't have this overprint. It seems that the first issues also
exist cancelled (but I've never seen them). A short review of
these stamps can be found in '<em><strong>Philatelic forgers,
their lives and works</strong></em>' by V.E.Tyler, 1976. There is
also an image of an educational booklet with the stamps mounted
in it, distributed by the Tatham Stamp &amp; Coin Company
(Tasco). These forgeries were offered indiviual, cancelled or
uncancelled, in blocks or even full sheets. They were still
offered in the 1950's. Springfield forgeries are frequently found
in many collections and often offered in whole series on popular
Internet auctions. </p>

<p align="left">I found the following information on
http://jlkstamps.com/fakes/fakecsa.htm, concerning the
distinguishing characteristics of these Springfield forgeries:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/confor13.jpg" width="195"
height="235"></p>

<ul>
    <li>The 5 c Jefferson Davis (green or blue) facsimiles differ
        from the originals in the paper used and in the overall
        appearance. The facsimiles have a flat appearance, and
        the vertical lines under the value are incomplete or
        missing altogether. </li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/confor19.jpg" width="171"
height="221"></p>

<ul>
    <li>The 10 c Thomas Jefferson (red or blue) differ from the
        originals in the paper used and in the appearance of the
        portrait design and the general flat appearance. The
        lower lip is quite strange. These forgeries have distinct
        cross-hatching around the portrait whereas the genuine
        stamps have only a suggestion of cross-hatching. </li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/confor25.jpg" width="181"
height="229"></p>

<ul>
    <li>The 2 c Andrew Jackson forgery is the most dangerous.
        Remember that the paper that is different. There are
        missing periods after the &quot;C.S.A.&quot; and the
        crossbar of the &quot;T&quot; of &quot;TWO&quot; is
        usually not connected to the upright bar. </li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/confor32.jpg" width="165"
height="203"></p>

<ul>
    <li>The 5 c Jefferson Davis forgeries are 1 mm narrower than
        the originals and the lines of color in the background
        and the face are the same intensity. In the originals,
        these lines of color are darker in the background and
        lighter on the face. </li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/confor48.jpg" width="171"
height="207"></p>

<ul>
    <li>The 1 c John. C. Calhoun facsimile is clearer and more
        detailed than the original but still has a somewhat dull
        appearance and was printed on very white paper. The
        facsimile is also 1mm taller than the original. </li>
    <li>The other values are easier to distinguish; the genuine
        stamps are all engraved whereas the facsimiles are not
        engraved. </li>
</ul>

The first image shows a cut from a Scott album of 1886, second
and third forgeries based on this cut. The face is very strange
and the &quot;O&quot; of &quot;ONE&quot; is placed too low.
Actually, this 'forgery-image' already appeared earlier in
&quot;The illustrated catalogue of postage stamps&quot; by
J.E.Gray of 1870 on page 115 (fourth iamge). It also appeared in
the catalogue of <a href="torres2.htm">Placido Ramon de Torres</a>
&quot;Album Illustrado para Sellos de Correo&quot; of 1879
(information passed to me thanks to Gerhard Lang, 2016) on page
184 (fifth image).</p>

<p align="left">Forgeries similar to the image of a <a

<p align="center"><img src="usa/confor23.jpg" width="181"

First image shows a cut from a <a href="scott.htm">Scott album</a>
of 1888, the second image shows a forgery based on this cut.
Actually, very similar 'forgery-images' already appeared earlier
in Le Timbre Poste of February 1864 of <a href="moens2.htm">Moens</a>
(page 10) and the catalogue of <a href="torres2.htm">Placido
Ramon de Torres</a> &quot;Album Illustrado para Sellos de
Correo&quot; of 1879 (information passed to me thanks to Gerhard
Lang, 2016) on page 184 (third image). The Moens and de Torres
images are slightly different (see for example the arching in the
upper right ornament).</p>

<p align="left">The banner below 'TWO CENTS' is almost straight
in these forgeries. I have also seen this forgery in the colour
red. The nose is very thin and pointed, there are no dots behind
'C', 'S' and 'A'. The 'P' of 'POSTAGE' resembles a 'D' and the
'G' of this word is very strange. This is the forgery described
in Album Weeds.</p>

(Birmingham forgery and scroll at right hand bottom of a red
stamp)</p>

<p align="left">The scroll at the right hand bottom is made in a
circular shape instead of an oval in the genuine stamps. I have
also seen this forgery in the colours green, red and black. The
Birmingham forgeries are not very common. I think this is the
first forgery described in Album Weeds. The collar on the right
side of the stamp seems to be part of the beard in this forgery.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/confor4.jpg" width="191"
height="241"></p>

<p align="left">In the above forgery the background is solid and
the top of the stamp is almost straight, not at all as in the
genuine stamps. I have seen this particular forgery in the
colours green and blue in different shades from light to dark.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="scott.htm">Scott forgeries</a>:</p>

<p align="left">Forgeries similar to the image of a Scott stamp
album of 1888 were used to produced forgeries, they can be
recognized by the solid background and the chin is different from
the genuine stamps. The printing stones of the catalogue might
have fallen into private hands. Later forgeries have a defective
lower right corner (last image above). I've also seen this
forgery in blue, red and orange.</p>

<p align="left">In the forgeries made by S.C.<a href="upham.htm">Upham</a>,
the background consists of square dots. On early prints, the
cheek has some shading on it (see first image above). They were

light green, dark green, blue, orange and red.</p>

<p align="left">Scott (the same from the catalogue!) made
forgeries of the 5 c Jefferson Davis stamp. It was made from
pieces of the original plate and therefore looks very deceptive.
The value part had been redrawn (since Scott got the printing
plates of an unissued 10 c in which he removed the value label
and put back another 'FIVE CENTS' label). These forgeries are
quite common. The Dietz handbook says that the distinguishing
characteristics of this forgery are: 'the outer framing line (of
the forgery) is three times as thick as that on the genuine
stamps; and, the center bars of the 'F' and 'E' of 'FIVE' (in the
redrawn portion) are noticeably shorter than in the originals'.
Even perforate specimens exist of this forgery. This forgery is
also known as the 'New York' forgery. This forgery is also
mentioned in 'Album Weeds' as the second forgery, it has been
printed probably somewhere around 1900.</p>

blue, blue on red, black, violet on yellow, violet etc.</p>

(Sperati forgery, reduced size)</p>

<p>This Sperati forgery is quite rare. The distinguishing
characteristics are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The upper right star has a color dot in the center. </li>
    <li>The 1 of the lower left 10 has a color smudge at the
        bottom. </li>
    <li>A white smudge can be found below and slightly to the
        right of the '0' in the lower left '10'</li>
</ol>

<p>Sperati has also forged cancels. Some of them are even applied
to genuine stamps (and on his forgeries of course). The most
famous is a New York City PAID 12 ship marking on a 2 c Andrew
Jackson stamp. Other postmarks that he was known to have forged
are Charleston SC; Chattanooga, Tenn (Aug 8, 1863); Cincinnati,
O; New Orleans, La / 2 (partial strike); and Richmond, Va (July
9, 1863 and May 10, 1865). Sperati forgeries are quite valuable,
however, his cancel forgeries are not very valuable. More

<p align="left">The above forgery is very crude.</p>

<p align="left">I know of a Senf forgery, with on the backside
the inscription 'Facsimile No. 10'. This forgery was given free
with the stamp magazin: 'Das Illustriertes Briefmarken-Journal'
(about 1880-90).</p>

<p align="left">Sperati forgeries are extremely dangerous. Most
of them are signed on the back with the Sperati signature (but
not all). There are a number of minor distinguishing marks, the
easiest test is the 'T' and 'E' of 'TEN'; they are joined at the
top (they are separate in the genuine stamp). Also, there is a
white dot to the right of the 'E' of 'POSTAGE'. Sperati seems to
have made two reproductions, A and B; they are the same except
that in A there is a colourless dot in the scroll between
'CONFEDERATE' and 'POSTAGE', in B this dot in the scroll has been
connected. For Sperati postmarks, see under the 10 c Thomas
Jefferson.</p>

<p align="left">The above forgery is lithographed, there is a
thin frame line at the top, the 'O' of 'POSTAGE' is too high and
not on the curved line. I think this is the forgery described in
'Album Weeds', the word 'CENTS' is badly done compared to the
genuine stamps.</p>

<p align="left">This must be the forgery described in 'Album

to distinguish.</p>
