<p align="left">The republic of Stellaland existed from 1882 to
1885, and was then divided between <a href="s_afrtra.htm">Transvaal</a>
and <a href="bechu.htm">British Bechuanaland</a>. Stellaland did
not cancel its stamps with the usual cancelling devices, instead
only penstroked were used (mostly the initials of the postmaster
&quot;FH&quot; and date). Cancelled stamps could have
occasionally occured when the letters arrived in neighbouring
countries (the town of Barkly in the Cape, but most are simply
forgeries).</p>

<p align="left">For the specialist: these stamps have no
watermark and are perforated 12 (also 11 1/2). They were issued
on the 1st February 1884 and printed by Van de Sandt de Villiers
in Cape Town and used until 2nd December 1885. The word
&quot;POSTZEGEL&quot; means &quot;stamp&quot;. The surcharged
stamp was was not issued, the stock was sold to a dealer (The
forged stamps of all countries by J.Dorn). Only 384 stamps were
surcharged. The 1 p, 3 p, 4 p, and 1 Sh were issued in sheets of
96 stamps (twelve rows of 8), the 6 p was issued in sheets of 117
(13 rows of 9). There are 8 main types of the 1 p, 3 p, 4 p and 1
Sh and 9 types of the 6 p stamp. The remainders were confiscated
by the British and sold to Whitfield King &amp; Co in 1886.
Stamps with one side imperforate exist (horizontal or vertical).
Black 6 p proofs (perforate or imperforate) are known. </p>

Most common 'cancel' a pencancel with the initials of the
postmaster &quot;FH&quot; and date. &quot;FH&quot; refers to
Ferdinand Hartzenberg. Other (much rarer) pencancels with
&quot;FCD&quot; (Frans Coenraad Dekker) or &quot;CGD&quot; (C.G.
Dennison). Source:

Stamp with &quot;A.V. Riet P.M&quot; manual cancel.</p>

<p align="left">Some information was given to me by Kas Erné
(The Netherlands), which I summarize as follows:<br>
<em>After the British victory in Stellaland, the British forces
confiscated all Stellaland stamps and subsequently send them to
London, where they ended up in the stamp trade. The stamps were
printed by Van de Sandt de Villiers &amp; Co in Capetown, after a
first request to print the stamps to Hartley &amp; Son
(Kimberley) failed (Hartley received a image of the desired
stamps, but he never replied). The stamps were used from 1 April
1884 to 2 December 1885. The surrounding countries (Transvaal,
Orange Freestate and Cape of Good Hope) did not recognize the
stamps and additional postage had to be paid for letters in
transit. Cancelling devices did not exists and the postmaster
applied his signature and a date on the stamps. The letters were
then transferred to Christiana (Transvaal). Such genuine letters
are very rare. <br>
Forgeries were already reported in the philatelic press as early
as 1887. One (unlikely) theory is that a fired employee of the
printer (de Villiers) took a printing stone home and made
forgeries of those. Another theory states that the printer
himself (de Villiers) continued making reprints since Stellaland
had not paid the bill (this does not explain the difference in
design between the forgeries and the genuine stamps). It could
also be possible that the printer Hartley made forgeries in order
to compensate for the expenses that he had made (with a possibly
slightly different design that he had received, possibly the most
common forgery shown below could originate from this source). <br>
The 'Twee' overprint is most likely an unauthorized issue created
by the postmaster of Vrijburg.</em> <br>
Christiana in Transvaal used the numeral &quot;6.&quot; cancel
and can sometimes be found on stamps of Stellaland. The latest
stamps were just cancelled by a (blue) penstroke.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="s_afr2/stellalandEnv4001.jpg"
width="598" height="469"><br>
Probably a genuinely used letter, stamps are cancelled by hand
and a towncancel &quot;BARKLY&quot; (Cape of Good Hope) is
applied elsewhere on the letter. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="s_afr2/stellaland14.jpg"><img
src="s_afr2/stellaland14.jpg" border="0" width="274" height="280"></a><br>
Genuine stamp with &quot;VRIJBURG&quot; cancel. I'm not certain
that the cancel is genuine. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="s_afr2/stellalandcan10.jpg"><img
src="s_afr2/stellalandcan10.jpg" border="0" width="247"
height="267"></a><br>
Very dubious &quot;CORREIO&quot; cancel of 1 May 1884.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="s_afr2/stelgosh3001.jpg" width="266"
height="291"><br>
Mysterious item with &quot;GOSHEN PENCE BETAALD&quot; in violet
and &quot;Twee&quot; in red; possibly a proof for the neigbouring
Goshen Republic.</p>

src="s_afr2/stellaland3012.jpg" border="0" width="280"
height="339"></a><br>
What are these? Proofs? </p>

<p align="left">Many forgeries exist (since the stamps have no
watermark and a relatively easy design), the first forgeries
already appeared in 1887. Examples of forgeries:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="s_afr/stelfor1.jpg" width="971"
height="592"><br>
Forgeries with &quot;VICTORIA&quot;, &quot;A07&quot; and also a
New Zealand Dunedin cancel. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="s_afr2/stellfor1.jpg"><img

src="s_afr2/stellalandfor4005.jpg" border="0" width="247"
height="273"></a> </p>

<p>Distinguishing characteristics of these (classical) most
common forgery type:<br>
1) The left leaf in the bottom should not touch the ribbon in the
genuine stamps. <br>
2) There should be two shading lines entering the star in the
shield from the left hand side (this is absent in the forgeries).
<br>
3) The perforation is also different from the genuine stamps
(genuine stamps have 17 teeth at the top and bottom). </p>

<p>I have even seen forgeries of the 1 p stamp in the wrong
colour: green instead of red. Forged cancels on genuine stamps
exist. Also genuine stamps with the perforation cut off (to
imitate imperforate proofs) exist. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="s_afr2/stelmaybefournier.jpg"
width="273" height="322"><br>
With &quot;FAUX&quot; overprint, a forgery sold by <a
href="fournier1.htm">Fournier</a>; most likely one of the
forgeries made by the &quot;Maison V.E.U.&quot; of Genoa in
1920-1921 by a new process (as also shown in the Fournier Album).
Around that time, the forger Nino Imperato was also active in
Genoa. </p>

Dangerous forgery with &quot;EEN PENNY&quot; shorter than in the
genuine stamps. The bottom right part of the upper star is a bit
too short. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="s_afr2/stellaland11.jpg"><img

Another forgery type. The star on top is not well done and the
leafs at the bottom are different. Next to it a &quot;Twee&quot;
on 4 p forgery.</p>
