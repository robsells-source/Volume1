<p>Many forgeries exist of the first issue: see
http://www.kashmirstamps.com/index.html. Also very dangerous
forgeries are known to exist and this collection area is full of
pitfalls..... Even experts got confused about which stamps are
genuine and which ones are not in the past. Check if a stamp is
not one of the worthless modern 1980's forgeries, which are often
offered as genuine. Then there are watercolor printings, oil
pritings, special printings, a variety of papers (local or
European), unofficial reprints, very dangerous forgeries etc etc.

<p>I have seen forgeries of these stamps, printed from the
original die. They are different from the so-called Brighton
forgeries made by <a href="treherne.htm">Harold Treherne</a> from
1902 to 1907. These forgeries are rather deceptive. See also
http://www.sspak.com/library/India/Jammu%20&amp;%20Kashmir%20Forgeries.pdf.
<br>
The site http://www.kashmirstamps.ca/SMcontents.html contains
valuable information about these stamps. It is an (improved?)
online version of the book 'T<em>he Stamps of Jammu-Kashmir'</em>
by Alexander Séfi &amp; C.H. Mortimer (1937). Publisher: Séfi,
Pemberton &amp; Co., Ltd., 12 South Molton Street, W.1. London.
322 pp, 59 black &amp; white plates. The forgeries described are
the so-called 'Die I' forgeries (longtime believed to be the
genuine stamps!) and 'Missing Die' forgeries. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Die I forgeries:</h4>

<p>Once considered to be genuine and quite rare (and hence at
some stage very expensive....). They are always printed in
watercolor. The outer circles are not circular enough and the
text is badly done (which was considered as a sign of
genuineness, which forged the Jammu and Kasmir authorities to
make a new die with better lettering). Only the 1/2 a and 4 a
were forged (possibly in Paris France in the 1870's), they exist
with red seal cancels: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="india2/jammuWatercolorforg1.jpg"
width="245" height="244"><br>
Water color forgery. This might actually be a &quot;Die I&quot;
forgery, once considered to be genuine. </p>

<p align="left">They were considered to be genuine up to 1899,
when Sir David Masson went to Kashmir and published an article in
the Philatelic Journal of India, Vol.III, 1899 (source Dawson). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Missing Die forgeries: </h4>

<p>'Missing Die' forgeries, believed to be from a 'missing die'
that could not be found in the archive, it later turned out to be
forgeries. These forgeries appear to have been made (and sold) by
corrupt post office officials to stamp collectors, but also to
replace genuine stamps. When the archives were checked for
genuine stamps, most of them were replaced by these 'Missing Die'
forgeries. They appear to have been made in the 1890's. There are
two types of the 4 a forgeries. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="india/cashm1.jpg"><img

'Missing die' forgery of the 1/2 a value, the three strokes in
the center should not touch the white 'sun' in the genuine
stamps. In the 'Missing Die' forgeries it does. See also
https://www.stampboards.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&amp;t=39738. The
character on top that looks like a &quot;3&quot; extends its foot
towards the left and touches the character to the left of it (in
genuine stamps it bends away to the right). </p>

'Missing Die' forgery of the 1 a value. The upwards stroke of the
central character points straight to the &quot;3&quot; (it points
to the right of it in the genuine stamps). The inverted
&quot;R&quot; shaped letter at the bottom left has a split leg. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="india2/kashMissingDieForgs.jpg"
width="600" height="264"> <br>
'Missing Die' forgery Type I of the 4 a on the left. The central
line points to the symbol above it in the forgeries. In the
genuine stamps, it points in between two values. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="india2/jammu5063.jpg" width="240"
height="239"><br>
'Missing Die' forgery Type II of the 4 a. The letter that looks
like a greec 'pi' has both legs straight instead of slightly bent
as in the originals. </p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="left">Brighton (Treherne) forgeries:</h4>

<p align="left">These forgeries are quite deceptive. They exist
of all three values and in many colours (both watercolours and
oil colours). </p>

<p align="center"><a href="india/jammu39.jpg"><img
src="india/jammu39.jpg" border="0" width="305" height="291"></a> <img
src="india2/jammu5071.jpg" width="261" height="270"> <br>
This could possibly be Brighton forgeries? The 4 a Brighton
forgery has a &quot;?&quot;-alike letter just to the left of the
&quot;3&quot;, which these stamps appear to have. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="india2/jammu5074.jpg"><img
src="india2/jammu5074.jpg" border="0" width="269" height="247"></a><br>

width="241" height="262"><br>
I've been told this is a Brighton forgery of the 1 a value. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="left">Long &quot;R&quot; forgeries:</h4>

<p align="left">Forgeries exist where the leg of the 'inverted R'
has a very long tail. The central number is like a squarish blob.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="india2/jammu5078.jpg" width="257"
height="244"> <br>
This might be the Long R forgery.</p>

<h4 align="left">Die X Forgeries:</h4>

<p align="left">Rare forgeries of the 1/2 a and 1 a values. </p>

Die X forgery of the 1/2 a; image taken from
https://www.stampboards.com/viewtopic.php?t=13744&amp;start=350
The first one of the central three strokes is too curved. The
word 'Jammu' is strangely done at 1 o'clock (see als
https://www.kashmirstamps.com/FWater.html) </p>

<p align="center"><a href="india2/jammu5077.jpg"><img

<h4 align="left">Forgeries with star cancels and 'snake' forgery:
</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="india/jammu20.jpg"><img

border="0" width="277" height="289"></a> <br>
Highly dubious stamps, the cancel looks like the one that the
stamp forger <a href="oneglia1.htm">Oneglia</a> sometimes used on
his forgeries. Although these look like the Snake Forgery shown
below, there are differences (for example double outer circle). </p>

<p align="center"><a href="india2/jammu5067.jpg"><img

A 'snake-forgery' (so-called due to the snake like pattern in the
lower right hand side), it also has a single outer ring. This
forgery appears to be the same as the one illustrated in the
Illustrated Catalogue of Postage Stamps by John Edward Grey from
1870.</p>

<h4 align="left">Mirror image forgeries of the 4 a (and 'normal'
ones of the other values):</h4>

These 4 a forgeries are printed in reverse (mirror image)! Note
the cancels that appear identical to the ones appearing on the
previous forgery type</p>

Fournier forgeries, taken from the Fournier Albums in Geneva
(thanks to Gerhard Lang for taking photos of them), all in mirror
image. So these forgeries must have been produced before 1928
(when the Fournier Albums were assembled). They are listed under
Cachemir (Jummo) in his 1914 pricelist and were offered for 1
Franc (1/2 and 1 anna). </p>

A set of forgeries with the same cancel. They are in

There they are shown without cancels, they are reported in the
colours blue, red, black, grey and brown.</p>

<h4 align="left">Modern forgeries (1980's): </h4>

<p align="center"><img src="india2/indiaforgs15.jpg" width="840"
height="849"><br>
A whole bunch of forgeries of different states, all made by the
same forger, I presume (<a href="indstmodfor.htm">from Allahabad
in India</a>). The Jammu and Kasmir forgery is at the bottom
left. I've seen exactly the same forgery in the color green as
well. The second item in the bottom row is also supposed to be
from Jammu and Kasmir (a Jammu iron-mine seal copied from a
Stanley Gibbons catalogue); this seal was temporary used as a
stamp (extremely rare), it is usually a 'cancel' in black.
Millions of these forgeries were dumped in the market in the
1980's-90's.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="india2/jammuStanleyGibbons.jpg"
width="436" height="612"><br>
Copied from the Stanley Gibbons catalogue 'Stamps of the British
Empire 1912', these images were the inspiration for the modern
forgeries made in India. Note that the 1 anna and 4 annas values
are wrongly attributed. </p>

The same forgery as in the above collection. The circular frame
imperfections are always identical for each value. These are most
likely <a href="indstmodfor.htm">modern forgeries</a> printed in
the 1980's. They were printed in red, purple, green, black, blue
and yellow. I've seen many of these forgeries being offered as
genuine. In fact, most stamp offered on Ebay are these
(worthless) forgeries. Badly printed so-called <a
href="indiafor.htm">Indian forgeries</a> of mainly British
Colonies also exists, they are probably from the same source,
since both appear with forged &quot;975&quot; cancels. </p>

Supposed to be from Jammu and Kasmir (a Jammu iron-mine seal
copied from a Stanley Gibbons catalogue); this seal was temporary
used as a stamp in red (extremely rare), it is usually a 'cancel'
in black (but very blur) on the circular Jammu and Kashmir
stamps.</p>
