<h2 align="center">ABERDEEN CIRCULAR DELIVERY COMPANY.</h2>

<p align="left">David Stirling writes:</p>

<p align="left"><em>This Company was one of the farthing circular
delivery companies formed by Robert Brydon of Edinburgh, and
emulating the system and pricing of the Glasgow Parcel Delivery
Company which, for some twenty years previous, had been
undertaking the same task at the same competitive prices.
Although other writers have hailed this form of cheaper delivery
as an innovation of Brydone's, such was not really the case. The
stamps appeared in July, 1867, but there is no conclusive
evidence that they were ever put into actual use. The stamps were
lithographed in sheets of 130, 10 across by 13 down. The farthing
value is the scarcest of the two stamps. They were manufactured
by James Edward Nixon Brydone, Printer and Lithographer, of
Edinburgh, the father of Robert Brydone. His printing
establishment was at 12 Elder Street.</em></p>

<p align="left"><em>The farthing value is normally more heavily
printed than the halfpenny stamp and many of the stamps, being
smudged and badly printed, were destroyed. This accounts for its
relative scarcity. No used or imperforate specimens, of either
stamp, have been noted. </em></p>

<h2 align="center">EDINBURGH &amp; LEITH CIRCULAR DELIVERY
COMPANY</h2>

<p align="left"><br>
David Stirling writes: </p>

<p align="left"><em>The Edinburgh &amp; Leith Circular Delivery
Company was the first of Robert Brydone's circular delivery
companies and, at first, shared premises with Edinburgh &amp;
Leith Parcel Delivery Company, at 12 St Andrew Square. Despite
what may have been said by other writers, the idea of circular
delivery was not novel and, indeed, had been practised by the
Glasgow Parcels Delivery Company since 1846. Both Edinburgh
Companies had been formed towards the end of July, 1865. Robert
Brydone was one of the two sons of James Edward Nixon Brydone,
Publisher, Printer and Lithographer of 17 Hanover Street,
Edinburgh, whose printing presses operated from 12 Elder Street,
Edinburgh.<br>
Parcels wagons had been running for many years between Edinburgh
and Leith, and the parcels service was no innovation. The
Circular Delivery Company was, however, controversial in nature
being aimed at a large slice of the GPO's revenue and was
destined, eventually, to attract the jaundiced attention of the
Postal Authorities, even though Brydone had sought legal advice
before taking up the venture.<br>
The Company immediately issued stamps, and these were chronicled
in Moens' &quot;Le Timbre Poste&quot; for December, 1865. Local
stamps were not novelties in Scotland as an issue had taken place
as early as 1811, when a Scottish Shipping Company issued their
own packet stamps. However, the stamps of the Edinburgh &amp;
Leith Company chanced on the scene when philately was in its
first bloom and attracted attention all over the country. W. S.
Lincoln eventually held a fine stock of them but defaced them by
cancelling them with a blue crayon. The stamps were lithographed
by James Edward Nixon Brydone from designs made up by George
Oliver, engraver and die sinker, of Edinburgh.</em><br>

<em>Used copies of the genuine stamps are extremely rare, copies

desirable. On cover, they are class one rarities. In 1939, 12
Elder Street (and adjoining buildings) was demolished to make way
for the new Omnibus Station of the Scottish Motor Traction
Company Limited (who also issued parcels stamps!). Due to the
war, however, and afterwards, by difficulties with planning
permission, the project did not reach fruition until April 5th,
1957, when the official opening of the new Bus Station took
place. And to crown it all, the last occupants of 12 Elder Street
were David Short &amp; Sons.....Printers!</em><br>

<h2 align="left">EDINBURGH &amp; LEITH PARCEL DELIVERY COMPANY</h2>

<p align="left"><br>
David Stirling writes again: </p>

<p align="left"><em>This Company was formed, by Robert Brydone,
towards the end of July, 1865 and issued its first stamp in
August of that year. This was a yellow label, undenominated, in
the design of Brydone's immediately succeeding Circular Delivery
stamps. The design was by George Oliver, of Edinburgh. The stamp
was chronicled in Moens &quot;Le Timbre Poste&quot; and, although
these were designed for use on parcels, some were used on
circulars until the supply of Circular Delivery Company stamps
arrived. In April, 1866, a second design appeared depicting a
parcels wagon being driven along at a spanking pace. This latter
design was forged on at least two occasions, one of the forgeries
being by our old friend, Samuel Allan Taylor of Boston.<br>
The Edinburgh &amp; Leith Circular Delivery Company was, at
first, based at the same address, 12 St Andrew Square, but, on
Robert Brydone's bankruptcy, his father James took over the
Circular Delivery Company and removed it to his printing works at
12 Elder Street.<br>
Cancellation of the stamps on parcels was usually effected with a
pencil or crayon. W. S. Lincoln, the stamp dealer, cancelled a
stock of mint copies, in the mistaken belief that it would be
illegal to sell them in their mint state. This was after the
Circular Delivery Companies' prosecutions, in 1869. I have been
unable to trace any of the Company's activities after the year
1866.</em><br>

<p align="left">David Stirling writes: </p>

<p align="left"><em>This Edinburgh Company first was noted as a
stamp-issuer in 1866, when a small blue stamp of farthing
denomination was brought into use. The firm had opened a parcels
and circular delivery office, in early 1866, at 10 Carlton
Street. The stamps appeared in two sizes, either 23.5mm. or
25.5mm. wide. These stamps were lithographed se-tenant in the
sheet, which consisted of 72 stamps (8 across X 9 down). There
were, therefore, 36 of each type in the sheet. The stamps were
imperforate.<br>
The Clarks were no newcomers to the parcels delivery service,
having had experience of parcels and goods delivery between
Edinburgh and Leith for many years. George Clark, grandfather of
the proprietor, was operating one of the daily Leith Parcels
Wagons in 1829.<br>
The stamps were of no stated denomination but sold at 3d per
dozen. They were lithographed by Robert Clark, Stationer,
engraver and lithographer at his shop in 15 Elder Street. Robert
Clark lived at 26 Dublin Street in 1866, moving to 13 Leopold
Place, in 1867, and also operated the delivery service.
Cancellation was by a heavy black score with indelible pencil or
crayon, not to be confused with the straight blue pencil cancel
applied by W. S. Lincoln to copies he sold. This was in the
mistaken belief that it was illegal to sell local stamps of this
type uncancelled. Only two undoubtedly genuinely used copies have
been seen by me (David Stirling). Forgeries are unknown.</em><br>
