<p align="left">I have been able to find theWarwick stamps below
in an old catalogue of 1864 (Moens catalogue with illustrations),
but they could have been produced by <a href="taylor.htm">Taylor</a>
(other sources say they are produced by <a href="unitehus.htm">Hussey</a>,
probably many forgers were active in this field; only look at the
large number of different types for these stamps; there are at
least 17 different types).</p>

<p align="left">The Pennypost website
(https://www.pennypost.org/pdf/farrell/WarwicksCDP_FarrellCollection.pdf)
claims that there might actually have been a real Warwick's post
in New York city in 1858. It is unclear which stamp was the
original 'Warwick' stamp. The owner of this original post appears
to have been Charles S. Warwick (who also goes by the name Hall
or Taylor? but 1858 seems too early for Allan Taylor who only
started forging stamps around 1862). He was convicted of fraud
for accepting 500$ to deliver letters (which he never did).</p>

Forgeries made by Hussey, the last image is a reproduction from
an image from a Moens catalogue. There are also some varieties in
the Hussey type, note that the &quot;I&quot; in &quot;CITY&quot;
is placed higher in the first stamp. Also note the &quot;.&quot;
instead of a &quot;:&quot; above the &quot;R&quot; of
&quot;WARWICK&quot; in the first stamp. Note the position of
&quot;Dis&quot; in the block of four stamps. The second stamp
might be the 'original' Warwick stamp. </p>

With &quot;I&quot; in &quot;CITY&quot; printed higher. </p>

Slightly different type, note the short upper part of the
&quot;K&quot; for example. This forgery was clearly motivated by
an image in the Moens catalogue of 1864.</p>

This forgery type was made by Hussey. A subtype exists with no
spur on the bottom of the &quot;2&quot; (also note the position
of the &quot;t&quot; of &quot;Post&quot; in the above block of
four). A very similar type was also produced by (or based on an
image by) Moens. A third type very similar to the above one has
the apostrophe different. This type is also shown in the Moens
catalogue of 1864. </p>

These forgeries (including the one with diamond border) were made
by the forger <a href="taylor.htm">Taylor</a>. </p>

<p align="left">&quot;Warwick's City Dispatch Post 2 c&quot;, a
local fantasy supposedly to have operated in New York In the
'Standard Guide to Postage Stamp Collecting' by Bellars and
Davie, 1864 are listed 2 c black on yellow (chain border), 2 c
black on yellow (diamond border), 2 c black on yellow (border of
straight lines) and 2 c red. But other values exist (for example
the 6 c black on green or 6 c black on red, see pictures above).
It must have been made in or before 1864.</p>
