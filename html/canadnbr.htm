<h4>Cancels, examples:</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="canad/sanda199.jpg"

<p align="center"><img src="canad/sanda200.jpg"

width="194" height="196"> <br>
Cancel consisting of 9x9 dots applied to remainders. </p>

<h4>Reprints</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="canad2/newbofficialrepr.jpg"><img
src="canad2/newbofficialrepr.jpg" border="0" width="218"
height="221"></a></p>

<p>Official reprints exist of all three values. The colours are
different: 3 p orange, 6 p violet and 1 Sh violet. They are all
printed on white paper (originals on bluish paper).</p>

<h4>Forgeries, examples:</h4>

<p>There are some very dangerous forgeries, in which the size of
the stamp is slightly larger (23.8 mm instead of 23.0 mm, source:
'Fakes &amp; Forgeries of New Brunswick &amp; Prince Edward
Island by Captain R.B.Mitchell) and the colours are slightly
different. Another dangerous set of forgeries bears the cancel
'8' in a grid (made by Oneglia/Panelli) and there is a small line
from the thistle (the flower at the right hand side of the crown)
to the background.</p>

<h4>Third forgery (<a href="spiro.htm">Spiro</a> A):</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="canad/newbfor3.jpg"><img
src="canad/newbfor3.jpg" alt="Forgery! Flower upside down"
border="0" width="229" height="238"></a> <a
href="canad2/newbrfor2000.jpg"><img src="canad2/newbrfor2000.jpg"
border="0" width="436" height="449"></a></p>

<p align="left">In the above forgery, the flower in the lower
right corner is upside down (it is pointing towards the crown)!
The stems of the flowers must point to the crown. The background
behind the outer inscriptions is completely solid. Besides the
5-lines cancel shown above, I have also seen this forgery with a
cancel consisting of 4 concentric circles, roughly the size of
the stamp. It is believed that <a href="spiro.htm">Spiro</a> made
this forgery (there also exists another Spiro forgery, see next
forgery). </p>

<h4 align="left">Fourth forgery (Spiro B):</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="canad/newbrasis1.jpg"><img
src="canad/newbrasis1.jpg" border="0" width="227" height="238"></a>
<img src="canad/newbfor1.jpg" width="261" height="258"> <a
href="canad2/newbrfor56.jpg"><img src="canad2/newbrfor56.jpg"
border="0" width="216" height="224"></a></p>

<p align="left">The octogonal outline round the center is double
in the above forgeries. The postmarks on these forgeries seem to
be a large diamond, containing 6 parallel lines (Papal States
cancel) or the one indicated on the right (a quartefoil, or
spider cancel of Spain). Also note the unclear circular postmark <a
href="forgVFcan2.htm">&quot;DOCTWL... VF&quot;</a> (unreadable
letters, a cancel often used on other forgeries of other
countries as well). Note that all the numerals '3' in the corners
are directed towards the center of the stamp, while in the
genuine stamp they are all pointing downwards, this is the
easiest test to determine these forgeries (this forgery is also
described in 'The Spud Papers'). It is believed that <a
href="spiro.htm">Spiro</a> made this forgery, although I have
actually some doubt that this is true. </p>

<h4 align="left">Fifth forgery:</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="canad/newbfor2.jpg"><img
src="canad/newbfor2.jpg" alt="Forgery!" border="0" width="235"
height="243"></a> <a href="canad2/newbfor2d.jpg"><img
src="canad2/newbfor2d.jpg" border="0" width="225" height="233"></a>
<a href="canad2/newbrfor3001.jpg"><img
src="canad2/newbrfor3001.jpg" border="0" width="224" height="226"></a>
<a href="canad2/newbrunswick3001.jpg"><img
src="canad2/newbrunswick3001.jpg" border="0" width="229"
height="217"></a> <a href="canad2/newbfor3.jpg"><img
src="canad2/newbfor3.jpg" border="0" width="304" height="307"></a>
<br>
I've also seen this forgery with a numeral dot cancel
&quot;2479&quot; and &quot;1959&quot;. I've also seen it with a
circular cancel with unreadable letters and a sun(?) in the
center. I am not able to read the number in the above numeral
cancel ('31??'). Also a cancel consisting of an image of a 108
parales Rumania stamp and some sunburst cancel.</p>

<p align="left">In this forgery the crown is too small also (it
should almost touch the octagonal), and furthermore the
inscriptions are not in the right place (or the crown is not
placed correctly)! Also note that the flower at the right hand
side of the crown (turn the stamp) has been replaced by somekind
of a berry. It is supposed to have been made in Italy. A better
version, but with the same errors exists and is sometimes said to
be a Fournier forgery (but this is not sure), it then bears a
square cancel consisting of small dots. It might actually be of
French origins, due to the presence of French cancels on it. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="left">Sixth forgery:</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="canad/newbfor6.jpg" width="213"
height="215"></p>

<p align="left">Note the position of the '6' in the corners in
the above forgery of the 6 p.</p>

<h4 align="left">Seventh forgery:</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="canad2/brunasis1.jpg" width="196"
height="196"> <a href="canad2/brunasis1d.jpg"><img
src="canad2/brunasis1d.jpg" border="0" width="198" height="203"></a>
<a href="canad2/brunasis1e.jpg"><img src="canad2/brunasis1e.jpg"
border="0" width="219" height="217"></a><br>
The 3's in the corners are totally different from the genuine
stamp. I've also seen it cancelled with a pattern of dots. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="canad2/newbfor15.jpg"><img
src="canad2/newbfor15.jpg" border="0" width="238" height="231"></a><br>
In the 1 sh of this forgery type the &quot;12&quot;s in the
corners have been replaced by &quot;1&quot;s.</p>

<h4 align="left"><a href="oneglia1.htm">Oneglia forgeries</a>:</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="canad2/newbforOneglia2023.jpg"><img
src="canad2/newbforOneglia2023.jpg" border="0" width="218"
height="221"></a> <a href="canad/brunoneglia1.jpg"><img
src="canad/brunoneglia1.jpg" border="0" width="210" height="221"></a>
<a href="canad2/newb_maybeOneglia1.jpg"><img
src="canad2/newb_maybeOneglia1.jpg" border="0" width="218"
height="202"></a><br>
(Oneglia forgeries)</p>

<p align="left">Oneglia forgeries are engraved. Note that they
are cancelled with a grid &quot;8&quot; cancel. According to the
journal BNA Topics (May, 1972 page 116), in an article called
'The Panellis' by E.A.Smythies, this forged cancel has two
unbroken lines besides the &quot;8&quot;, while the genuine
cancel only has one such line. The genuine cancel '8' belongs to
Chatham New Brunswick, it was also applied by Oneglia/Panelli on
forgeries of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. </p>

<h4 align="left">Forgeries made by 'forger A':</h4>

<p align="left">Some forgeries, all made by the same forger 'A': </p>

<p align="center"><a href="canad2/newbfor12.jpg"><img
src="canad2/newbfor12.jpg" border="0" width="638" height="204"></a>
<a href="canad2/newbrfacs4001.jpg"><img
src="canad2/newbrfacs4001.jpg" border="0" width="209"
height="208"></a> </p>

<p align="left">The above forgeries are often referred to as
forgeries made by forger 'A' (the identity of this forger is
unknown'. The name 'forger A' was suggested by Nicholas Argenti
in his book 'The Postage Stamps of New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia'. Often these forgeries have an overprint
&quot;FAC-SIMILE&quot; (which is sometimes erased and/or covered
by a cancel). These forgeries are engraved. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="canad2/novfor12.jpg"><img
src="canad2/novfor12.jpg" border="0" width="221" height="211"></a><br>
I've been told that this forgery of the 6 p Nova Scotia stamp has
been made by the same forger 'A' as the above three forgeries.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="canad2/novscnewbrforgs1.jpg"
width="515" height="337"> <img src="canad2/novscnewbrforgs1b.jpg"

These might have been produced from this printing plate with New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia stamps side by side in two blocks of
four as they are now in the possesion of the Canadian Museum of
History after having been discovered in a flee market in Belgium
in 2013. Last picture in mirror-image. See also:

<h4>Forgeries, examples:</h4>

<p><a href="spiro.htm">Spiro</a> forgeries:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="canad2/brun5ford.jpg"><img

alt="Type 1" border="0" width="203" height="235"></a> </p>

<p align="left">Forgeries of the 2 c, 5 c and 10 c (as images
above) exist with no &quot;-&quot; between &quot;NEW&quot; and
&quot;BRUNSWICK&quot;. Another easy way to identify these
forgeries are the cancels (these cancels were never used in New
Brunswick). Note, that there appear to be two types of the 10 c
forgeries, differing in the positions of the &quot;X&quot;s in
the upper corners. </p>

<p align="left">The above forgery of the 17 c stamp is made by <a
href="spiro.htm">Spiro</a> I presume. There should be a brooch on
the shoulders of the Prince, but it is absent in this forgery.
The lines of tartan coming from the Prince's shoulder are ending
on the first stroke of the first &quot;N&quot; of
&quot;SEVENTEEN&quot; and the &quot;T&quot; of this word, in the
genuine stamps it ends in the center of the first &quot;N&quot;
of this same word. This forgery has been described in 'The Spud
Papers'.</p>

there is a &quot;-&quot; between &quot;NEW&quot; and

<p align="left">These labels are forgeries made by (or inspired
by) Allan <a href="taylor.htm">Taylor</a> in or before 1865 with
the help of Craig and Melvin (both stamp dealers in Canada). The
train design exists in a number of colors (red, blue, brown,
black) and on colored paper. A sub-type seems to have a blotch in
the frameline next to the bottom left '2'. The design with 'PAID'
in the ellipse seems also to exist in the colors 2 p black on red
and 2 p black on green. </p>

<p align="center">AN EXPOSE!!!</p>

<p>BALDWINS RAILROAD POSTAGE : an obsolete local of considerable
rarity&quot;-as it is impudently termed by dealers interested in
its sale-is attracting some attention at present in Philatelic
Circles. Of course the venders of these stamps affirm stoutly
that they are genuine ; but we beg to assure buyers that this is
not the case. The &quot;Baldwin&quot; is a forgery and the Boston
dealer who now advertises it as genuine knows that it was made to
<em>sell</em> only. For the information of our readers we submit
a brief historical sketch-gleaned from authentic sources - of
this stamp. <br>
In the month of May last two young gentlemen belonging to this
city entered into copartnership - which for distinction sake we
shall call Messrs &quot;A. and B., Stamp and Coin dealers.'' They
had been in business but a short time when it occurred to them
that they might &quot;get up&quot; a stamp. Others had done so
with some degree of success, why could not they? Only represent
it to their correspondent as a genuine &quot;local&quot; issued
and used in the province of New Brunswick, and by its sale they
might easily replenish their coffers, and increase their business
many fold. Having hit upon this &quot;happy thought &quot; the
next thing wanted was a name and date. The latter was easily
settled ; it should be an <em>obsolete local</em>, for this would
sell best and be least liable to detection. But the name, -what
should it be? This was a puzzler ! It could not be &quot;Turner's
&quot; -or the &quot; Eastern'' Express, for both of these
companies had agents in almost every city, town and village of
the Union, as well as in the British Provinces, an application to
either of whom might ''spoil their <em>leetle </em>game.&quot;
After much grave thought and consideration it was remembered that
a Mr. H. Baldwin had had some years before, an express office on
the European and North American Railway, which runs from St. John
to the Shediac oyster beds. Why not therefore call the
&quot;obsolete local&quot; BALDWIN'S RAILROAD POSTAGE<br>
Nothing could be more favourable and the name was at once
adopted. After sketching a rough design of the projected
&quot;obsolete,&quot; the <em>honourable</em> firm went next in
search of an engraver whom they soon found in the person of a Mr.
Gregory of this city. Mr. Gregory being an adept in his art soon
furnished a block or cut of the new stamp, which was taken to the
printing establishment of Messrs J. &amp; A. McM..... of St.John,
and shortly after our <em>enterprising </em>young gents had the
satisfaction of gazing upon the fruit of their own ingenuity-or
in other words upon fifteen hundred of the &quot;BALDWIN'S
RAILROAD POSTAGE LABELS&quot; in the following colours: viz, red
on white, blue on ditto., black on ditto., red on grey, blue on
ditto, black on ditto, red on green, blue on ditto, black on
ditto, red on yellow, blue on ditto, black on ditto, red on blue,
blue on ditto., black on ditto. That such stamps should be
rare-very rare indeed- no one can doubt, for they could only be
had from the makers. We do not know that the manufacturers are to
blame altogether for saying that these stamps were of
&quot;considerable rarity&quot; -seeing they could only be
obtained from themselves, -but every honest man will say that
they were very much to blame for stating that they were NEW
BRUNSWICK LOCALS. But further, we have it on good authority, that
of these &quot; gems, &quot;<em>four hundred were sold to </em><a
href="taylor.htm"><em>S. Allan Taylor of Boston</em></a><em> </em>-
as stamps that <em>never existed,</em> but <em>were issued to
sell only</em>. Mr. Taylor knows all this, but does he denounce
the imposition? oh no! On the contrary, he tries to bolster it up
by &quot;a change of base,&quot; and mendaciously says in his
paper, &quot; that the New Brunswick to which these bogus
&quot;obsolete locals'' belong is New Brunswick - <em>New Jersey</em>!!!
Could anything be more audacious? Can he tell us or his readers
when these TWO PENNY locals were <em>issued</em> and <em>used</em>
in New Jersey? and why it is that no mention is made in any of
the NewY ork Price Lists or American Catalogues of the U. S.
local stamps? We hope that our readers will make a note of what
we have said and avoid the Bogus &quot; Baldwin's.&quot;</p>
