Portrait of Samuel Allan Taylor, image obtained from the Canadian
Philatelist, July/August 2021, Vol.72, No.4, page 160.</p>

<p align="left">S.Allan Taylor was the leader of the 'Boston
gang'; a group of forgers located in Boston (see '<em><strong>Philatelic
forgers, their lives and works</strong></em>' by V.E.Tyler, 1976,
for a short review of his life). <font size="3">He was born in
1837 (source: Fred J. Melville in Mekeel's Weekly 21 October
1935). Taylor operated from about 1862 to 1891 and made many
forgeries and bogus United States stamps. Many of these exist
printed in a variety of papers and in a wide range of colors. <br>
He first lived in Canada (Montreal) where he got interested in
stamps after a visit to </font><a href="nutter.htm">J.A.Nutter</a><font
size="3">. He also issued 'The Stamp Collector's Record' from
1864 to 1867. During this time he was involved in the Baldwin
Railroad local stamps scam. He got into an argument with
J.A.Nutter over bogus Canadian Bancroft locals. J.A.Nutter made
an original design, but didn't like it and ordered a second
design. Meanwhile Taylor produced forgeries of the first design.
Later he moved to the US (Albany first and Boston later). During
the Boston time he initially collaborated with </font><a
href="trifet.htm"><font size="3">Ferdinand Marie Trifet</font></a><font
size="3"> and later with James M.Chute, </font><a
href="lyford.htm"><font size="3">Charles A.Lyford</font></a><font
size="3">, </font><a href="taylor.htm"><font size="3">William
E.Skinner</font></a><font size="3"> and </font><a
href="seltz.htm"><font size="3">C.M. Seltz (Frederick H.King)</font></a><font
size="3">. He was also responsable for some bogus Prince Edward
Island stamps. The above information was partly obtained from
'Philatelic forgers, their Lives and Works' by V.E.Tyler. In 1890
he was arrested for making foreign forged stamps. </font></p>

(Bogus issue made by Taylor with his self portrait: Kers City
post, for an imaginary local post in Canada)</p>

<p align="left">The stamps of Kers City Post, presumably a
Canadian local post, but in actuality the post never existed and
these stamps are completely bogus fabrications of S. Allan
Taylor. The man shown here is a self-portrait of Taylor. These
bogus stamps must have been issued in or before 1864, since it is
already listed in the 'Standard Guide to Postage Stamp
Collecting' by Bellars and Davie (issued in London, 1864 by John
Camden Kotten), it is listed under New York in this catalogue. I
have seen the 2 c blue, 2 c green, 2 c red, 2 c brown, 5 c blue,
5 c green, 5 c brown and 5 c red. </p>

<p align="left">Another design for the Kers City Post exists with
arms or some kind of hat(?) in the middle:</p>

Taylor also offered these bogus stamps in his pricelist (see
above): &quot;Kers City Post (arms) 3 Pence&quot; and &quot;Kers
City Post 1 Penny&quot;.. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/chuteTaylor.jpg" width="482"
height="253"><br>
(Black and green stamps of J.M. Chute Letter Despatch)</p>

<p align="left">J.M. Chute was actually a forger (see 'Philatelic
forgers, their lives and works' by V.E.Tyler), closely
collaborating with Taylor. The above 'local stamps' are presumed
to be made by Taylor.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/uslittl1.jpg" width="218"
height="240"><br>
(Little Wanderers Aid Society)</p>

<p align="left">The &quot;LITTLE WANDERERS AID SOCIETY&quot; is
supposed to show the portrait of Taylor as a boy. Besides the 2 c
grey, 2 c red, 2 c black on lilac, 5 c green, I have seen 10 c
red, 10 c black on blue, 10 c blue, 10 c black on red and 10 c
black on yellow. The 10 c values has shading over the circles
with value indication.</p>

<p align="left">I've been told that the next stamps are bogus
local stamps made by Taylor as well. I have no further
information concerning these stamps.</p>

and black on lilac should also exist. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/albany2.jpg" width="232"
height="271"><br>
Albany Letter Express; this stamp appears to be a mix of the
designs of the Pomeroy Express (for the frame) and Boyd's
Despatch (for the eagle). It was already reported in 1865. It
exists in several colors: black on yellow, black on orange, blue,
green, red. </p>

also seems to have made a 'Warren Ave. Church Fair P. O.'

&quot;Hourly Express Post Letter Stamp One Cent&quot;; the four
types, different colours</p>

<p align="left">The &quot;Hourly Express Post Letter Stamp&quot;
is probably made by Taylor. Though I have seen it in the nicely
illustrated book 'The world of classic stamps 1840-1870' by James
A. Mackay (a picture of this stamp can be found in this book,
with the text: '1 c, Hourly Express Post, 1859').<br>
There are four types of this label (other forgers have imitated
this bogus issue, such as Hussey who printed it i sheets of 12
stamps). <br>
In type I (shown above), the inscription in &quot;HOURLV&quot;
with a &quot;V&quot; at the end and the first &quot;S&quot; of
&quot;EXPRESS&quot; is very badly done, there is no &quot;,&quot;
behind &quot;STAMP&quot; and no &quot;.&quot; behind
&quot;POST&quot;. It exists in blue on white or grey paper.<br>
In type II there are no dots or commas behind the words
&quot;POST&quot; and &quot;STAMP&quot; (as in Type I). In the
word &quot;POST&quot;, the &quot;T&quot; does not touch the
frameline and the letters &quot;ST&quot; are not joined at the
top. It exists in blue, black on blue, black on yellow, black on
orange, black on lilac, black on green and red on yellow.<br>
In type III there is a &quot;.&quot; behind &quot;POST&quot; and
a &quot;,&quot; behind &quot;STAMP&quot;. It only exists in black
on green color.<br>
Type IV resembles very closely type III, but there is a small
break in the lower frameline (below the &quot;CE&quot; of
&quot;CENT&quot;). There are other minor differences with Type
III. It only exists in black on green paper (the green color is
lighter than that of Type III). </p>

<p align="left">In the above design ('Squire City Express Post')
I have also seen 2 c orange, 2 c brown on yellow, 2 c black on
yellow and 2 c violet. </p>

<p align="left">I have been able to find theWarwick stamps below
in an old catalogue of 1864, but they could be produced by Taylor
(other sources say they are produced by <a href="unitehus.htm">Hussey</a>,
probably many forgers were active in this field; only look at the
large number of different types for these stamps; there are at
least 17 different types): <a href="warwick.htm">Click here for
more Warwick</a> stamps. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="usa/warwick.jpg"><img

design as the above forgeries; two values exist: 5 c red and 20 c
green. According to a Siegel auction, the genuine design has
faint vertical lines in the vignette background around the head
of the horse. Genuine stamps also show at least a part of the
rouletted perforation. Only six 5 c red stamps and two 20 c green
stamps are known to exist. I have even seen two 5 c green

similar in design to the Spence &amp; Brown stamps. </p>
