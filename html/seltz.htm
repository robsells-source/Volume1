<p>Seltz was a collaborator of 'The Boston Gang' (under the
guidance of S.A.Taylor) and might have even been an invented
person. </p>

<p>A message from the Stamp Collector's Record, reproduced in the
'Stamp Collector's Magazine' of Nov. 1. 1867, page 172 reports
his death resulting from working too hard on a stamp book.....: </p>

<p><em>A MARTYR TO PHILATELY.&#151; It is with feelings of deep
regret that we are called upon to announce the decease, after a
short illness, of Mr. Frederick H. King (better known as C. M.
Seltz), which occurred on the evening of Sunday, the 13th August,
after an illness of eight days' duration. The causes which
resulted in his untimely end are, unfortunately, too clear. For a
month or two past Mr. King has been assiduously engaged in the
preparation of his handbook, the which he not only edited, but
'set-up' the typographic forms with his own hand, so that the
book was in every respect particularly his own production.
Naturally of a delicate constitution, his overtasked energies at
last succumbed, inflammation of the brain supervened, and, after
a brief illness, his labours, his hopes and his cares were for
ever at an end. - Stamp Collector's Record. </em></p>
