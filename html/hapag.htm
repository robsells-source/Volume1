(Genuine stamp on letter)</p>

<p align="left">This stamp was used by the Hamburg American
Packet Company (HAPAG) to be used on letters delivered by this
company to the Carribean and South America. The colour is black,
yellow and blue, the center is embossed with the company arms
(anchor). The perforation should be 12 1/2. The border of the
sheets containing 64 stamps were usually unperforated.</p>

<h4 align="left">Reprints:</h4>

<p align="left">I know that at least three different kinds of
reprints exist. A first reprint was made before 1938, at the
jubilee of the Hapag from new plates, the perforation is 14. </p>

<p align="left">A second reprint was made in 1938 for an
exhibition of the 'Deutsche Sammler Gemeinschaft'. They were
lithographed in sheets of 12 on white paper with thicker letters
and sharper embossing. In the right lower corner of each sheet
the word 'Nachdruck' (reprint in German) is printed. They are not
perforated and 20048 sheets were printed. </p>

<p align="left">A third reprint was made in 1955 (or 1958?) from
the same stones as the 1938 reprint. Sheets of 24 stamps were
made (two parst of 12 stamps with 12 stamps upside down). The
reprints were perforated 11 1/2 x 10 and had a lozenge watermark.

<p align="left">A miniature sheet with four reprints was made in
1975 at 'NORDPOSTA Tag der Hapag-Marke'. All four stamps have
'1975' in small letters written at the bottom. I've seen these
sheets with a fancy red cancel (with ship) or uncancelled. </p>
