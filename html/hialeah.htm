<hr>

<p>Some recent forgeries of many countries have originated from
the town of Hialeah (Florida, United States). They are commonly
known as Hialeah forgeries. A certain Mr. Canoura seems to be
behind these forgeries.</p>

<p>The seller 'atdinvest' (previously selling under the name
'futete', 'cclan', 'unlimitedstamps' and possibly other names) is
selling many of these forgeries on E-bay (2003), he says on one
of these auctions:</p>

<p><em>&quot;THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT ATDINVEST CAN DO FOR THE
PHILATELIC COMMUNITY. ALWAYS GREAT VALUES FOR THE AVID COLLECTOR
. THE GREATEST FORGERIES THAT HAVE EVER BEEN OFFERED. </em><br>
<em>Extraordinary forgery sheet to be used as reference material.
THE FINAL SOURCE FOR TRUE FORGERIES.ALWAYS A MASTERPIECE
ART-FORGERY FOR THE KNOWLEDGEABLE COLLECTOR.PRINTED IN EUROPEAN
A4 PAPER. <br>
THESE ARE PHILATELIC FORGERIES WITH NO POSTAL OR MONETARY
VALUE.&quot; </em></p>

<p>and later (August 2003):</p>

<p><em>&quot;THE FINEST AUTHENTIC REPRODUCTIONS OF GENUINE STAMPS
IN PHILATELIC HISTORY. A NEW EXPRESSION OF ART AND BEAUTY. THERE
IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT ATDINVEST CAN DO FOR THE PHILATELIC
COMMUNITY. ALWAYS GREAT VALUES FOR THE AVID COLLECTOR . THE
GREATEST ARTISTIC REPRODUCTIONS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN OFFERED&quot;</em></p>

<p>He also seems to have said:</p>

<p><i>&quot;collecting classics and expensive stamps is not a
privilege anymore for a few&quot;,everyone have the right to fill
that space in their albums at little cost.</i>&quot; </p>

<p>The same kind of reasons that the forger <a
href="fournier1.htm">Fournier</a> gave in the early 20th century,
when he massively sold forgeries.</p>

<p>In October 2003 this forger tried to sell his whole 'business'
on E-bay, a section from this item:</p>

<p><em>&quot;STAMP REPRODUCTION BUSINESS FOR SALE Artikelnummer:

prospects, the technology and secrets of the trade will be given
only in training. The description doesn't begin to describe the
full potential of the business. Owner is selling due to health
problems. &quot;</em></p>

<p>He did not manage to sell his forgery business (there were no
bids). I wonder if the 'health problems' are the real reason for
him to sell. A more likely reason is that the rules for selling
such forgeries have become stricter on E-bay. Anyway, this gives
a nice insight in how he conducted his forgery sales.</p>

<h1 align="center">Forged stamps</h1>

<p>The forger is selling whole sheets of rarities. I've written
to the seller atdinvest to get more information (how many stamps
he has forged etc.) but I got a nice reply in which he told me he
is too buzy to make a list of all his forgeries. As far as I have
seen, (before August 2003), these forgeries were never
perforated, nicely gummed but badly printed (on a colour laser or
inkjet printer?) and the size is also not always correct. The
list of stamps that he forged is really very long, and comprises
almost any rare stamp upto about 1945.</p>

<p>Recently, in August 2003, this seller also starts offering
cancelled stamps and perforated stamps as well.</p>

<h1 align="center">Forged overprints </h1>

<p>There also seem to exist forged overprints of this forger,
see: germacol.htm or
http://laplaza.taos.nm.us/~1covers/Hialeah/Hialeah.htm for more
examples.</p>

<h1 align="center">Forged stamps on genuine letters</h1>

<p align="left">Around June 2003 this seller also starts selling
cancelled stamps, even on envelope. For example a number of
envelopes with forged French 19th century stamps (and with added
forged cancels) was offered in August 2003. The envelopes are
probably genuine (some still contain some genuine stamps). The
perforation is always very badly done.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc/atdfrancov3.jpg" width="500"
height="680"><br>
(Hialeah forgery, genuine envelope, 3 forged 80 c French Colonies
stamps, reduced size)</p>

<p align="left">The above example is such a genuine envelope,
with 3 forged 80 c French Colonies eagle stamps and a forged 5129
numeral cancel, a forged 'Corr des armees' and a forged 'REGIMENT
DE TIR' cancel on the backside of the envelope.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc/atdfrancov1.jpg" width="500"

(Forged stamp of France together with forged cancels and genuine
stamps, reduced size)</p>

<p align="left">Another example is the above forged 1 F Napoleon
III stamp with forged '5129' numeral cancel, together with two
genuine stamps (which were probably present on the genuine
envelope). The Lyon cancel is genuine (I presume).</p>

(Forged 'Tonkin Corps Expedit' envelope with two 40 c French
colonies Ceres stamps)</p>

<p align="left">On the above envelope all the stamps and cancels
are forged. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc/atdfrancov9.jpg" width="500"

(Two forged 5 F commerce stamps with forged cancels)</p>

<p align="left">The above envelope has two 5 F commerce stamps
added, together with a forged '3122' numeral cancel and two
forged mute cancels. .</p>
