<p align="left">The 25 c black in the above design (man, probably
the owner, facing the left in an ellipse) was issued in 1854. Two
overprints exist &quot;OVER OUR CALIFORNIA LINES ONLY&quot; (in
red) and &quot;RATE 25c PER 1-2OZ&quot;. The intials
&quot;LR&quot; that can be found on some of the above stamps,
stand for 'Louis Reed'.</p>

<p align="left">Forgeries exist, example:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="usa2/adamsfor1.jpg"><img

src="usa3/adams19.jpg" border="0" width="249" height="290"></a><br>
Rather crude forgery; there is no &quot;.&quot; behind the lower
&quot;EXPRESS&quot;, produced by <a href="taylor.htm">Taylor</a>.
I've also seen this forgery in black on violet (see
http://www.cinderellastampsforum.com/classic-cinderellas-jw-scott_topic108.html).
The &quot;O&quot; of &quot;CO&quot; is very narrow, there is a
bar between the upper left &quot;2&quot; and &quot;5&quot;. The
last image shows the same forgery, but with shading lines on the
face. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="usa3/adamsfor1.jpg"><img
src="usa3/adamsfor1.jpg" border="0" width="244" height="288"></a><br>
Another slightly more convincing, but still very crude forgery.
This might have been produced by <a href="scott.htm">Scott</a></p>

<p align="left">Other designs with the man facing to the right
(in an octogonal shape or oval shape) were also issued:</p>

<p align="left">There is also a newspaper stamp with inscription
&quot;ADAMS &amp; COS EXPRESS ONE NEWSPAPER OVER OUR CALIFORNIA
ROUTES&quot;, in a similar design as the Wells Fargo stamps (see
image above). </p>

<p align="left">Furthermore some envelopes are known to exist of
this company (besides the 50 c there also seems to exist a 25 c
black and a 25 c blue in a different type):</p>

  1 c black (ornaments at left)
  2 c black (ornaments at left)
  2 c black on buff (&quot;ADAMS&quot; at left)</pre>
</div>

<p align="left">A reported 1 c with &quot;ADAMS&quot; at the left
(as the 2 c) seems not to exist. The decoration of the ornaments
in the 1 c black and 2 c black look identical, but there are
small differences. </p>

<p align="left">Reprints exist of the stamps with ornaments at
the left (no reprints of the 2 c &quot;ADAMS&quot; exist). They
are printed in black or blue and very difficult to distinguish
from genuine stamps; the only thing one can say is that the
printing plates were worn and will give to some small plating
defects in the reprints. I know that <a href="unitehus.htm">George
Hussey</a> made reprints (forgeries?) in the 1860's of at least
the 2 c blue from the original die (originals are in black).</p>

there). </p>

Probably reprints</p>

<p align="left">Forgeries are abundant (the genuine stamps are
very rare). There are at least 5 types of forgeries of the 1 c
value. </p>

<h4 align="left">Forgeries:</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/adamsasis1.jpg" width="160"
height="178"><br>
Forgery of the non-existant 1 c with &quot;ADAMS&quot; written at
the left hand side.</p>

<h4 align="left">First forgery of the 1 c</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/us2l3for.jpg" alt="Forgery!"
width="146" height="172"> <a href="usa/us2l3.jpg"><img
src="usa/us2l3.jpg" border="0" width="215" height="233"></a><br>
First forgery of the 1 c value, the ornaments at the left are
'hooked' at the top. The shading behind the '1' is too thick.
There is no &quot;.&quot; behind &quot;EXPRESS&quot;. The letters
&quot;RE&quot; of this word are joined at the bottom. </p>

<h4 align="left">Second forgery of the 1 c:</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/usAdams4026.jpg" width="204"
height="236"> <img src="usa3/usAdams4027.jpg" width="196"
height="239"></p>

<p align="left">The second forgery of the 1 c has the bottom part
of the &quot;C&quot; of &quot;CITY&quot; missing. The
&quot;T&quot; of this word has a too large upper right part.</p>

<h4 align="left">Third forgery of the 1 c (made by <a
href="taylor.htm">Taylor</a>):</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/usAdams4028.jpg" width="172"
height="185"><br>
Black on yellow Taylor forgery</p>

<p align="left">This forgery has a very strange &quot;O&quot; of
&quot;POST&quot;, it has no dot behind the word &quot;CENT&quot;.
Furthermore the letters &quot;XP&quot; and &quot;RE&quot; of
&quot;EXPRESS&quot; are joined at the bottom. I've only seen
these forgeries in bogus colours: black on lilac, black on yellow
and black on green. </p>

<h4 align="left">Fourth forgery of the 1 c:</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/usAdams4022.jpg" width="184"
height="228"><br>
4th forgery?</p>

<p align="left">This forgery is badly printed on very thin paper.
It exists in the colors black and blue. </p>

<h4 align="left">Fifth forgery of the 1 c:</h4>

<p align="left">Some forgeries with bogus colors exist (modern
reproductions?): red, black on red, red on yellow, black on
green, black on orange, black on red. </p>

<h4 align="left">Sixth forgery of the 1 c (photograph)</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="usa3/adamsrep1.jpg"><img
src="usa3/adamsrep1.jpg" border="0" width="165" height="183"></a><br>
Apparently a photograph of a genuine 1 c (the typical
photographical 'dots' can clearly be seen in this scan)</p>

<h4 align="left">First forgery of the 2 c (without
&quot;ADAMS&quot;)</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="usa/us2l4for.jpg"><img
src="usa/us2l4for.jpg" alt="Forgery!" border="0" width="186"
height="211"></a> <a href="usa3/adamsfor10.jpg"><img
src="usa3/adamsfor10.jpg" border="0" width="158" height="181"></a></p>

<p align="left">This forgery was made by the same forger as the
first forgery of the 1 c. There are a &quot;.&quot; and three
lines above the diamond in the upper part of the two (should be
six lines). There are three lines below this diamond (should be
six lines in the genuine stamp). This forgery exists in the
colors grey, black and blue. </p>

<h4 align="left">Second forgery of the 2 c (without
&quot;ADAMS&quot;)</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/cityfor2.jpg" width="155"
height="180"></p>

<p align="left">This forgery has a break in the horizontal line
above the &quot;PO&quot; of &quot;POST&quot;. It is probably made
by the same forger as the second forgery of the 1 c. It seems to
exist in blue color only. Also note that the ornaments at the
left hand side differ from the genuine 2 c stamps. </p>

<h4 align="left">Third forgery of the 2 c (without
&quot;ADAMS&quot;)</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="usa3/adamsfor2.jpg"><img
src="usa3/adamsfor2.jpg" border="0" width="193" height="224"></a>
<img src="usa3/usAdams4021.jpg" width="357" height="213"></p>

<p align="left">This forgery is badly printed on very thin paper.
It exists in the colors black and blue. It is probably made by
the same forger as the fourth forgery of the 1 c. The is an
oblique line coming out of the top of the &quot;C&quot; of
&quot;CITY&quot;, which touches the &quot;I&quot;. There are also
some breaks in the line above the &quot;O&quot; of
&quot;POST&quot;. </p>

<h4 align="left">Fourth forgery of the 2 c (without
&quot;ADAMS&quot;)</h4>

<p align="left">There is a &quot;.&quot; behind
&quot;EXPRESS&quot; in this forgery. The letters &quot;RE&quot;
of &quot;EXPRESS&quot; are joined at the bottom. </p>

<p align="left">Bogus items?</p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/adamspc1.jpg" alt="Type I"
width="223" height="221"><br>
Type I</p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/adams16.jpg" width="149"
height="152"><br>
Type I(?), reduced size, the letters &quot;A E Co&quot; are also
colored.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="usa3/adams15.jpg"><img
src="usa3/adams15.jpg" border="0" width="260" height="246"></a><br>
Type II</p>

<p align="left">Inscription: &quot;ADAMS EXPRESS COMPANY 59
BROADWAY, N.Y.&quot;, eagle design. <br>
Type I (see image above), I have seen these labels(?) in the
colours blue on white, blue on lilac and blue on yellow (all with
'A E Co' embossed in the central eagel, see above). The leaves
the eagle is holding are touching the wing. <br>
A Type II in blue on yellow color exists. This type has the eagle
slightly different. '59' is placed lower with respect to the
leaves the eagle is holding. These leaves do not touch the wing.
This is possibly the original envelope(?). </p>

<p align="left">Other &quot;ADAMS&quot; items (probably bogus):</p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/adams3.jpg" width="229"
height="184"> <img src="usa/usadam1.jpg" width="268" height="169"><br>

Allen's City Dispatch 125 Clark St.</p>

<pre>
1882 The following values exist
  red on yellow
  lilac
  black</pre>

<p>These stamps were issued in 1882 and are not very rare,
because the remainders were sold to a stamp dealer. Even though
these stamps have been forged (at least twice). A full
description of these forgeries can be found in 'Focus on
Forgeries' by Varro E. Tyler. The scythe handle should extend to
the second thin shading line on the left, in one of the forgeries
(the most dangerous one) it extends to fourth thin line. In the
second forgery this handle extends all the way to the frameline.
The genuine stamps are perforated 10, the forgeries 11 1/2, 11 or
imperforate. The next stamp has a wrong perforation, so it must
be a forgery:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="usa2/allenbog1.jpg"><img
src="usa2/allenbog1.jpg" border="0" width="184" height="206"></a><br>
Bogus issue, inscription &quot;ALLENS CITY DISPATCH 25 Clark
St&quot; with ornamental border (no person) similar to the one of
Gunn's Dispatch and Taylor's Charles van Diemen. Apparently the
&quot;,&quot; behind &quot;ALLENS&quot; and &quot;DISPATCH&quot;
and the &quot;t&quot; of &quot;St&quot; have almost disappeared
in this particular copy of this forgery. It seems to have been
made by Allan Taylor, although it only exists in red color. </p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="american"></a>AMERICAN EXPRESS
COMPANY</h1>

<h3 align="left">American Express Company</h3>

<p align="left">&quot;American Express Company. Postage Two
Cents. Paid.&quot;, New York (1856), 2 c black on green, these
labels are extremely rare (only a few have survived). It was not
clear for a long time, which stamps were genuine and which were
not. According to some sources, Smith's City Express Post was the
succesor of the American Express Company. The labels of these two
companies do indeed look very similar. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa2/siegel422.jpg"
alt="Image obtained from a Siegel auction" width="343"
height="193"><br>
This genuine stamp has two dots in the ornaments above each
&quot;A&quot; of &quot;AMERICAN&quot; (also two similar dots in
the bottom part). There is a &quot;.&quot; behind 'Paid' in the
genuine stamps.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/siegel35.jpg" width="332"
height="175"><br>
Genuine, image obtained from a Siegel auction, different type?
This looks like a forgery to me...</p>

<p align="left">Forgeries exist (at least five types), examples
of forgeries:</p>

<h4 align="left">First forgery (made by <a href="unitehus.htm">Hussey</a>)</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="usa/us4l1.jpg" width="320"
height="187"> <a href="usa/us4l1for1.jpg"><img
src="usa/us4l1for1.jpg" alt="Forgery!" border="0" width="324"
height="215"></a></p>

<p align="left">There is no &quot;.&quot; behind
&quot;Paid&quot;. Note the position of the lettering with respect
to each other. The &quot;P&quot; of &quot;EXPRESS&quot; is
aligned vertically with the &quot;P&quot; of &quot;Postage&quot;.
It was printed in vertical strips of three stamps. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="usa3/usAmericanHussey4001.jpg"><img
src="usa3/usAmericanHussey4001.jpg" border="0" width="394"

<p align="center"><a href="usa2/amerfor1.jpg"><img
src="usa2/amerfor1.jpg" border="0" width="301" height="151"></a></p>

<p align="left">The &quot;P&quot; of &quot;EXPRESS&quot; is
printed slightly in front of the &quot;P&quot; of
&quot;Postage&quot;.The corner ornaments are similar to the side
ornaments. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/americanrep4001.jpg"
width="1055" height="602"><br>
Sheetlet with these forgeries. </p>

<h4 align="left">Third forgery</h4>

<p align="left">Probably another forgery, with &quot;EXPRESS
COMPANY&quot; written very wide, the &quot;d&quot; of
&quot;Paid&quot; printed lower and the different frame type. If
my information is correct, it might have been made by Scott.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/american22.jpg" width="346"
height="189"> <a href="usa3/american10.jpg"><img
src="usa3/american10.jpg" border="0" width="338" height="195"></a><br>
Scott forgeries? These forgeries exists in three slightly
different types (note the missing lower right hand border in one
of the above types).. </p>

<h4 align="left">Fourth forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="usa3/amerfor5.jpg" width="314"
height="186"><br>
Forgery with no &quot;.&quot; behind 'Paid' and a very different
border pattern. </p>

<h4 align="left">Fifth forgery</h4>

src="usa3/american11.jpg" border="0" width="329" height="192"></a>
<img src="usa3/american12.jpg" width="308" height="191"><br>

design. Also there is no &quot;.&quot; behind &quot;Paid&quot;.</p>
