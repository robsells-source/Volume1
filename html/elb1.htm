<hr>

<p>Ferdinand Elb was a stamp dealer in Dresden (Germany,
Amalienstrasse 10 Dresden). See also 'Philatelic Forgers, their
lives and works' by Varro E. Tyler. Ferdinand Elb issued a
catalog or pricelist (probably in 1866 or 1867) &quot;Katalog
nebst Preisliste mit Beschreibung&quot; (can be downloaded with
Google Books). </p>

<p>Elb made good lithographic forgeries of the Saxony 1850 3 pf
stamp around 1865 (source: 'Praktisches Handbuch der Freimarken
des Konigreichs Sachsen' by Friedrich W.Dieck, 1921, see also
http://www.archive.org). They always(?) have a so-called
Vollgitterstempel, which is quite rare on genuine stamps
(according to the same source). </p>

Elb forgeries, or forgeries inspired by the Elb forgery. </p>

<p align="left">This is supposed to be a local issue for Berlin.
It is entirely bogus and made by the forger Ferdinand Elb. There
should be three values 1/2 Sgr, 1 Sgr and 2 Sgr. At least four
types of forgeries were made of this bogus stamps, probably one
of them by the Spiro Brothers. I do not know if the above stamps
are the 'original' or one of the 'forgeries'.</p>

<p align="left">Bogus ship company labels; 'Ne. Sachs. Bohm
D.S.E.G. Exped. Ab. Marke', probably made by Elb:</p>

(Steamship, inscription 'Ne. Sachs. Bohm D.S.F.G. Exped. Ab.
Marke.')</p>

<p align="left">These stamps are bogus, three values exist: 5 kr
(=1 gr), 10 kr (=2 gr) and 15 kr (=3 gr). There even seem to
exist forgeries of these bogus stamps! </p>

<h4>1869(?) Bogus issue for Kissingen-Schweinfurt (Bavaria):</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa5/kissingen1.jpg" width="560"
height="207"></p>

<p align="left">This issue is mentioned as 'Speculations' or
'Schwindelmarke' in Ferdinand Meyer's 'Handbuch fur
Postmarkensammler' (Nuremberg 1881). Strong doubts about the
genuineness of these stamps were already expressed in 'The
American Journal of Philately' 1869, page 119. They seem to have
been marketed by Ferdinand Elb (The Stamp Collectors Magazine,
Dec, 1869, page 179).</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Elb also made forgeries of the envelope stamps of
Finland. He also seems to have been involved in the Leitmeritz
bogus local stamps. </p>

<p align="left">On 5 August (or September?) 1864 Ferdinand Elb
went to Berlin with 100 reprints of the 4, 5, 6 and 7 Sgr
envelopes of Prussia (the reprints of 1864, not the original ones
from 1852). Some of them also had some reprint postage stamps
added. In Dresden he sold these envelopes to stamp collectors. He
then addreseed these envelopes to himself. The full story (in
Dutch) can be found at:
https://www.pzvgo.nl/index_htm_files/134%20Nieuwsbrief%20%20juni%202021.pdf</p>

Essays of the 1 Kr Wurttemberg arms issue, possibly issued by
Ferdinand Elb. I've also seen 1 k green on green, 1 k violet on
blue, 1 k brown and 1 k violet on green.</p>

<p align="left">According to the 'Neudrucke und ihre Kennzeichen'
(Reprints and their characteristics) of Ohrt the reprints in
phantasy colors of the 1 k Wurttemberg were made either for an
Englishman called Faiburn or for Ferdinand Elb from Dresden.
These 1 k reprints exist in the colors green, brown and violet.
They have no silk thread or a vertical silk thread (original
stamps only exist with a horizontal silk thread). Indeed, the
catalogue (or pricelist) of Ferdinand Elb of 1866 (or 1867?)
lists 10 &quot;diverse Essais 1 Kreuzer&quot; for 10 Neugroschen
(with silk threads &quot;mit Seidenfaden&quot;) or 20 essays for
5 Neugroschen without silk thread (&quot;ohne Seidenfaden&quot;).
At least Elb seems to have been involved in these 'essays'. <br>
Elb also offers 18 different essays of the 1 Kreuzer 1850
Wurttemberg stamp for 5 Neugroschen in the same catalogue. </p>

<p align="left">Elb also offers the 1865 Langton bogus ship
stamps (12 different, imperforate or perforated) in his 'Katalog
nebst Preisliste mit Beschreibung' from 1867(?) under Confederate
States. </p>

Possible Elb forgeries (there are two types of this bogus issue,
with &quot;MONEY&quot; or &quot;MOMEY&quot;, not sure which one
is made by Elb)</p>
