Portrait of Henry Hechler in the Toronto Philatelic Journal
(January 1888, Vol.2 No.7) at the occasion of him being candidate
for the Presidency of the Canadian Philatic Association. Another
portrait of him can be found in 'The Hobbyist', January 1910, No
XIII.</p>

<p align="left">Henry Hechler was born in 1853 in Germany
(Darmstadt) and moved to Halifax (Canada, 184 &amp; 186 Argyle
Street) around 1871 after he fought in the Franco-Prussian war.
He sold tobacco, coins and stamps for collectors. When the
North-West 'Indian and half-breed' Rebellion of 1885 broke out,
Hechler was involved as a captain of the 63rd Batallion Halifax
Rifles. During this time, Hechler made some 'Service' and other
bogus overprints on genuine Canadian envelopes. Some bisected 2 c
Canadian stamps were made by him, known as Hechler-bisects. These
were not allowed by the authorities, but somehow Hechler managed
to 'get them through the post'. Besides philately, he also was
possibly involved in some reprints of rare ferry tokens, (see for
example 'The Halifax Philatelist&quot; Vol.II, No.6, June 1888
Page 68), which he strongly denied (page 91 and 123 of the same
journal). </p>

Examples of Hechler's 'improved' envelopes. Usually a text 'HEAD
QUARTERS 63RD. RIFLES' or similar is printed at the left bottom
hand side. Even doubly printed 'errors' or double overprints in
different color were produced by him. </p>

A 'Hechler bisect', dated 'OCT 2 84'; I've seen a simialr bisect
with date 'OCT 22 84', all with Halifax cancel.</p>

<p align="left">Besides these 'stains' on his reputation, Hechler
seems to have been well respected by the collectors of his time.
For example 'The Halifax Philatelist&quot; Vol.II, No.6, June
1888 Page 68 writes when Hechler was accused of selling restrikes
of rare ferry tokens: <br>
&quot;<em>Of Mr. Fraser we know nothing good, bad, or
indifferent; but of Mr.Hechler, we may say, we have known him for
the last 12 years, and have never known or heard of anything in
his business transactions to his dirparagement. - His standing in
the community is sufficient to show in what estimation he is held
by those best able to judge from personal and constant
intercourse</em>&quot;. The discussion continues on page 91 of
this journal with a letter from Hechler himself. </p>
