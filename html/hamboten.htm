<h4 align="left">Hamburg is a Free City of the Hansa in the north
of Germany. Besides the official issues for <a
href="gstatham.htm">Hamburg</a> there also exists numerous local
issues.</h4>

<h1 align="center">The so called 'Hamburger Boten' institute
issues:</h1>

<p>Issued by C.Hamer, H. Scheerenbeck, W. Krantz, Th. Lafrenz and
Ch. van Diemen. Most of these stamps were only issued for stamp
collectors. Forgeries have been made in large quantities of these
stamps, I am not sure if the stamps shown here are genuine.
Probably most of them are forgeries!</p>

<h4>1863 Inscription &quot;Verein Hamburger Boten Th.
Lafrenz.&quot;</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa5/lafrenz4.jpg" width="247"
height="256"><br>
Probably genuine</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/lafrgen1.jpg" width="269"
height="137"> <img src="germa3/lafrgen2.jpg" width="268"
height="138"><br>
(Genuine, reduced sizes)</p>
<div align="left">

<pre>
  1/2 Sch. black on coloured paper
  1 Sch. black on coloured paper</pre>
</div>

<p align="left">The genuine stamps (quite rare) and official
reprints (also rare) don't have a dot behind &quot;Boten&quot;.
They also have small stars (8-rayed) left and right without a
white dot in the middle. 46 pearls can be found in the circle.</p>

<p align="left">Some varieties exist:<br>
<strong>For the 1/2 Sch: </strong><br>
1) Line at left hand top side of the &quot;z&quot; of
&quot;Lafrenz&quot;<br>
2) Black spot on pearls under &quot;B&quot; of &quot;Boten&quot;
and above &quot;n&quot; of &quot;Lafrenz&quot;<br>
3) Dot above second &quot;r&quot; of &quot;Hamburger&quot;<br>
4) A comma instead of a dot in the &quot;i&quot; of
&quot;Verein&quot;<br>
<strong>For the 1 Sch:</strong><br>
1) Dots in the figure of value<br>
2) The &quot;f&quot; of &quot;Lafrenz&quot; is damaged<br>
3) A comma instead of a dot in the &quot;i&quot; of
&quot;Verein&quot;</p>

<p align="left">There are also seven different kinds of
forgeries:</p>

<h4 align="left">First forgery (made by <a href="spiro.htm">Spiro</a>):</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa/lafr3.jpg" width="220"
height="232"> <img src="germa/lafr4.jpg" width="225" height="231">
<a href="germa4/lafre1b.jpg"><img src="germa4/lafre1b.jpg"
border="0" width="227" height="228"></a> </p>

<p align="left">The 1/2 Sch has 55 pearls, the 1 Sch 58 pearls.
The stars are large and have white dots inside them (though a
variety exists of the 1 Sch with no white dot in the right star).
There is a stop behind the word &quot;Boten&quot;. In the 1/2 Sch
the tail of the &quot;g&quot; of &quot;Hamburger&quot; is
disconnected, the &quot;e&quot; of this word has a curl on top.
The &quot;H&quot; of &quot;Hamburger&quot; of the 1 Sch value has
serifs. The following colours exist of these forgeries: black on
yellow (shades), black on grey, black on brown, black on lilac,
black on green, black on blue (shades) and black on violet. The
values 1/2 Sch and 1 Sch of the Spiro forgeries can be found
printed together, example:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/hamspir1.jpg" width="298"
height="151"><br>
(Spiro forgeries, 1 Sch and 1/2 Sch printed together, reduced
size)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa5/hamblafrenz1.jpg" width="1600"
height="1045"><br>
A whole sheet of 50 of these forgeries. </p>

<h4 align="left">Second forgery:</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="germa2/lafr6.jpg"><img
src="germa2/lafr6.jpg" border="0" width="251" height="242"></a> <img
src="germa/lafren2.jpg" width="236" height="241"> </p>

<p align="left">The stars are very large and 6-pointed, however,
they don't have a white dot inside them as in the Spiro forgeries
described above. A stop can be found behind the word
&quot;Boten&quot; (not present in the originals). The
&quot;z&quot; of &quot;Lafrenz&quot; has a prolonged upper right
hand side. The 1/2 Sch has 44 pearls in the circle, the 1 Sch
value has 46 pearls. <br>
I have seen this forgery in many colours; I have seen both values
in the colours: black on grey, black on yellow, black on orange,
black on green, black on blue, black on brown and black on
violet. <br>
Some varieties exist: the 1/2 Sch with an extra dot and circle
behind the &quot;z&quot; of &quot;Lafrenz&quot;, the 1/2 Sch with
line across the left lower corner and the 1 Sch with line across
the lower right corner. </p>

<h4 align="left">Third forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa5/lafrenz1.jpg" width="227"
height="231"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/lafrfor3.jpg" width="281"
height="140"><br>
(Reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">These forgeries have 51 pearls in the circle and
small 6-rayed stars. It can be noticed that the left star has a
prolounged downwards ray. Again a stop is present behind the word
&quot;Boten&quot; (which does not exist in the genuine stamps).
The &quot;g: of &quot;Hamburger&quot; has a small tail. </p>

<h4 align="left">Fourth forgery</h4>

<p align="left">1/2 Sch:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="germa5/hambboten1.jpg"><img
src="germa5/hambboten1.jpg" border="0" width="495" height="240"></a></p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/lafrenz1.jpg" width="200"
height="198"><br>
(Reduced size)</p>

<p align="left">The 1/2 Sch of this set of forgeries has two
rough 8-rayed stars. The left one is squeezed and the right one
has sometimes a dot at the lower right hand side. There are 46
pearls in the circle. The left vertical frame line is continued
downwards slightly. </p>

<p align="left">1 Sch:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/lafrfor4.jpg" width="153"
height="152"><br>
(Reduced size)</p>

<p align="left">The 1 Sch of this set of forgeries has 49 pearls
and two reasonably nice stars. </p>

<h4 align="left">Fifth forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/lafrfor5.jpg" width="583"
height="151"><br>
(Reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">The stars are 6-rayed and are small. There is a
dot behind &quot;Boten&quot;. </p>

<h4 align="left">Sixth forgery (made by <a href="scott.htm">Scott</a>)</h4>

<p align="center"><a href="germa5/Lafrenz2001.jpg"><img
src="germa5/Lafrenz2001.jpg" border="0" width="238" height="233"></a>
<a href="germa2/hambbot1.jpg"><img src="germa2/hambbot1.jpg"
border="0" width="246" height="230"></a> <img
src="germa4/lafrscott.jpg" width="194" height="185"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/lafrscott1.jpg" width="142"
height="140"><br>
(Reduced size)</p>

<p align="left">These forgeries were made by Scott (USA), there
are 46 pearls in the circle (as in the genuine). This circle is
not really round. There is also no dot behind &quot;Boten&quot;
(as in the genuine). The &quot;z&quot; of &quot;Lafrenz&quot; has
a line at the left hand top side. The &quot;Th&quot; is joined a
the top. In the 1 Sch there is a line below the second
&quot;r&quot; of &quot;Hamburger&quot;. I have also seen this
forgery in the non-existing colour red (both values). </p>

<h4 align="left">Seventh forgery</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="germa3/lafrfor6.jpg" width="279"
height="139"><br>
(Reduced sizes)</p>

<p align="left">I have only seen the 1/2 Sch of this particular
forgery. It has a 7-rayed star at the left and a 8-rayed star on
the right. The &quot;g&quot; of &quot;Hamburger&quot; has a very
peculiar tail. </p>

<p align="left">The 1 Sch of this forgery seems to have 50 pearls
(sorry, no pictures available yet).</p>
