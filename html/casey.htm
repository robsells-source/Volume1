Envelope of Casey. </p>

<p>A short history of Joseph J.Casey can be found in 'Philatelic
Forgers, their Lives and Works' by V.E.Tyler. He was editor of
'The American Journal of Philately' when he started selling
forgeries of the local stamps of <a href="usberford.htm">Berford
&amp; Co Express</a> (USA). Casey offered them as reprints from
the original plates. After discovering the truth and being
exposed by <a href="taylor.htm">S.Allan Taylor</a> in 1874, Casey
was removed from his editorship of 'The American Journal of
Philately' by the publisher, <a href="scott.htm">J.W.Scott</a>.
It is amusing that both Taylor and Scott are also listed in
V.E.Tyler's book on philatelic forgers..... The following text
can be found in 'The United States Locals' book by Coster on this
matter: <br>
&quot;<em>One original set of the Berford stamps is said to
exist, in the collection of an individual who, perhaps,
appreciating their rarity and desiring that the semblance of the
reality should be within the reach of all, caused
photo-lithographic &quot; reproductions &quot; to be made a
couple of years ago. These imitations (or &quot;reprints&quot; as
they were called by the individual already referred to) have been
fully ventilated in the columns of the Philatelic press.</em>&quot;<br>
Ironically enough, <a href="taylor.htm">S.Allan Taylor</a> is
also known to have made forgeries of these Berford stamps. </p>

<p>After this Casey started his own journal 'The Coin &amp; Stamp
Journal' in 1876, which was renamed as 'The Stamp Journal' in
1877.</p>

<p>Casey also made a bogus issue for Egypt (3 Aspers, showing a
pyramid). </p>

<p>He still advertised in The Dominion Philatelist of 1892,
Vol.IV, No.38, page 29 as:<br>
<em>COMPLETE SET<br>
&quot;Stamp Collectors Magazine&quot; of 12 volumes, choice
collection of 1600 Italian Municipals. Choice N. S, Envelopes.
Rare Essays and fine Proofs. What have you to excharge for these?
If you wish to sell your collection or duplicates. I can buy for
cash, paying highest prices or can sell same at auction at 0
percent. Liberal advances made on good collections. JOSEPH
J.CASEY, 26E 129th St, New York City.</em></p>

Photolithographed forgeries made by Casey of the values 6 c and
25 c of the Berford local stamps. </p>

<p align="left">Since these Berford stamps are photolithographed,
the design very closely resembles the genuine stamps (but the
details are slightly lost). In my view, the lines inside the
&quot;O&quot; of &quot;CALIFORNIA&quot; in the 6 c forgery are
more or less lost. Similar for the 25 c, the lines in the top
curl of the &quot;2&quot; have disappeared to a great extent. </p>

<p align="left">Walker's Penny Post: A bogus issue, I have seen
this stamp in the colours: black on red, black on yellow, black
on lilac, black on green, gold on green, gold on blue, and brown.
This forgery was made by Casey (see '<em><strong>Philatelic
forgers, their lives and works</strong></em>' by V.E.Tyler, 1976,
for a short review of his life). It should be noted that
forgeries of this bogus issue exist made by <a href="taylor.htm">S.Allan
Taylor</a> (the 'R' of 'WALKER' has a straight foot). </p>
