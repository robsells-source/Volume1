<p>Alwin Nieske elected himself as president of the
'Internationalen Philatelistenvereins Dresden', and issued the
journal 'Union' on 1 January 1877 (source
http://www.philatelistenverein-leipzig.de, his name is here spelt
Albin instead of Alwin). On 17 April 1880 Nieske was removed from
this association, since he had ordered forgeries to be made.
Apparenlty, the firm Salm in Plauen had indeed prepared forgeries
for Nieske (source 'Philatelic Forgers, their Lives and Works' by
V.E.Tyler). According to this source the following forgeries were
thus made:</p>

<p>Clover leaf stationary of Hannover<br>
Brunswick horses<br>
10 Ngr envelope stamps of Saxony<br>
3 pf red Saxony stamps (these were sold by Nieske, but might not
have been made by the Salm firm).</p>

<p align="left">Bogus stamps that Nieske might have been involved
in: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="india/jhinbog3.jpg" width="135"

height="189"> <br>
Bogus stamp of Jhind</p>

<p align="left">These bogus stamps were probably issued by a Mr.
Moquette of Dutch East Indies (see Filatelie informatief
September 1983 p 7060-10, in dutch). More values and values in
different colours exist. Moquette also made a bogus issue for <a
href="straijoh.htm#bogus">Johore</a>. All these stamps were also
sold by the stamp dealer Friedl in Vienna. Moquette also made
several bogus overprints on genuine stamps of Dutch East Indies.
Two of the images were found at
http://home.att.net/~rickscott/Unidentified/Unk376.html and
http://home.att.net/~rickscott/Unidentified/Unk377.html.<br>
The Stamp Almanac (Almanach du Timbre-Poste) by J.B.Moens of 1886
shows an image of the red bogus stamp shown above (16 March) with
the following text: &quot;<em>MM Senf frères se décident à
parler et nous disent enfin où le type ci-contre est en usage.
Cela ne leur procure aucune difficulté, vu qu'ils ont été les
seuls à vendre ces timbres.</em>&quot; (Translation: The <a
href="senf.htm">Senf brothers</a> decide to talk and finally tell
us where the stamp shown here is used. This doesn't give them any
problems, since they are the only ones selling these stamps.).
The 1/2 Rupee stamp is shown in the same book on 12 April, while
making fun of the Illustrirtes Briefmarken Journal (issued by the
Senf brothers). <br>
On the other hand, Moens in 'Le Timbre Poste' no 182, page 11
(1878) shows an image of the above stamp (elephant desing) with
the message that Moens obtained this stamp from <strong>A.Nieske</strong>,
implying that Nieske might have been involved. </p>

Text from Union, No.13, 1st January 1878 by Alwin Nieske,
presenting a new issue for Punjab, which was send to Nieske by
Mr.Moquette of Soerabaya (a famous forger from Netherlands
Indies). </p>

<p align="left">Furthermore, in 'Le Timbre Poste' no 182, page 13
(1878) the name <strong>Alwin Nieske</strong> is mentioned again
when the Monterey bogus issue was first described (it was not
known then that these stamps were bogus). Indeed, in the Union,
No.16 of 1st April 1878 (issued by Nieske), this stamp is on
offer for 60 Mark: &quot;<em>Mexico, 1 Monterey, Raritat, etwas
ladirt (nur in einem Stuck vorrathig</em>&quot;. The above shown
'Punjaub' 1/2 Rupee black on yellow was offered for 10 Mark. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have not been able to find many forgeries
made by Nieske. If anyone has more information, please contact
me!</p>

<p>He does offer 'Cliches' of the illustrations of his journal
Union for 1 Mark each in 1880.</p>
