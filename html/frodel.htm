These forged '2 CENTS' overprints on King George V stamps of
Canada are often wrongly attributed to Andre Frodel. the right
one has a triple surcharge</p>

<p align="left">The following information was passed to me by Ken
Pugh concerning the above forgeries:<br>
<em>&quot;Frodel never worked with overprints. There is quite a
story to&nbsp;these.&nbsp;Fred Eaton, a prominent Vancouver
dealer and benefactor to Frodel,&nbsp;was in possession of the
Frodel estate (including a stock of his forgeries) when the
Vancouver Police was investigation Frodel's forgery activities.
To avoid a problem, he backstamped the Frodel forgeries in his
possession FORGERY or FAKE&nbsp; ANDRE FRODEL. As Eaton, has in
his possession other forgeries from other makers (also his
friends) he backstamped those two. These included many
overprints, OHMS and G officials, even some perfins. The maker of
these &quot;Frodels&quot; was probably Alex MacMaster, a
Vancouver printer and friend of Eaton. I suspect
&quot;Frodels&quot; are being backstamped to this day to satisfy
the forgery collector market.&quot;</em></p>

<p align="left">The article 'The Frodel Story' by Bill Topping in
BNA Topics/ January-February 1993 (accesible online) has more
info on Andre Frodel and Harris Alex MacMaster. It seemst that
MacMaster was the printer for the forgeries that Frodel produced.
Frodel was an engraver, originally from Poland, with a great
knowledge of paper. He moved to Canada in 1948. He seems to have
been very pleased with his fantasy productions, such as the 2 c
green Admiral with the center in red or the imperforate 5 c
beaver 1859 stamps. The above mentioned Fred Eaton acquired a
trunk with stamps and printing dies (1000 to 2000 stamps with
about 20 % 'fun' objects). The following dies (27 in total) were
found in the trunk: <br>
1) British Columbia (3 dies) for single stamps as well as
multiples together with the value surcharges '10 CENTS 10', '25
CENTS 25', '50 CENTS 50' and '1 DOLLAR 1'. <br>
2) '2 CENTS' and '2' over 'CENTS' probably for 1899 Victoria
provisional issue and 1926 Admiral surcharges. <br>
3) 6 cent surcharge on the 1930 5 c airmail issue. <br>
4) 'O.H.M.S.' surcharges (for 1948 and 1951 stamps)<br>
5) 1959 Saint Lawrence Seaway red portion (possible used to make
double printings or inverted prints)<br>
6) Poland nr. 1 (10 dies).</p>

<p align="left">Other 'creations' of Frodel concerning Canada
(auctioned in a Schuyler Rumsey auction in 2010 from the Carl
Walske collection):<br>
1) a bogus 1922 5c King George V tete-beche block of four,<br>
2) imperforate pairs of the King George V 1924 7c, <br>
3) various 1930-50's commemorative imperforate stamps including a
bogus 1951, 5¢ Steamship pair, <br>
4) 5c Seaway fantasies including a invert pair<br>
From the United States (from the same auction):<br>
1) 1c Pan-Am inverts, <br>
2) Prexie imperforated pairs, <br>
3) 4c Parks imperforated between, <br>
4) 1938 54 Eagle Airmail imperf horizontal block, <br>
5) various 1920-30's issue imperf pairs used on cover<br>
