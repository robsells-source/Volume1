Also with &quot;Read a copy of STAMP LIFE LATELY?&quot;
overprint. Apparently made by A.C.Roessler.</p>

<p align="left">The above oversized stamp of the arms issue of <a
href="gstabad3.htm">Baden</a> doesn't have any value inscription.
The inscriptions are different from the genuine stamps. I have
also seen this label in blue and orange. The size of this label
is larger than the genuine stamps (about 1 1/2 times). I've been
told that it was made by A.C. Roessler, who overprinted these
labels with advertising messages. He also sold unoverprinted
labels to other dealers. I've seen such abels in blue, green and
orange, also with a black overprint &quot;WE SELL THE AMERICAN
HINGE 15 c per 1000&quot;, also a blue label with &quot;WE TAKE
SUBSCRIPTIONS to ROESSLER'S STAMP NEWS&quot; in black. </p>

<p align="left">Some forgeries of the 5 Drachma Crete 1905 issue
with overprint &quot;USE THE PERMANENT STOCK BOOK WE SELL
IT&quot; or &quot;AMERICAN STAMP DEALERS' ASSOCIATION, INC.&quot;
are also believed to have been made by or prepared for Roessler.</p>

<p align="left">He also seems to have been very active in
'fabricating' first-day airmail letters. When he ran out of
genuine covers, he seems to have produced false ones to meet the
demand. </p>
