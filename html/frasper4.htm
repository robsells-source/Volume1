<p align="left">Sperati used a few genuine cheap stamps, bleached
out the design (with the cancel remaining intact) and reprinting
it. However, the majority of the forgeries of France made by
Sperati are total forgeries, thus the cancel was also forged. The
paper used by him is very close to the paper of the genuine
stamps. I know that Sperati made forgeries of the 10 c, 15 c, 40
c and 1 F values of the 1849 issue (several 'reproductions'). He
also made forgeries of the 2 c, 4 c, 20 c, 30 c and 80 c 1870
Bordeaux issue. More images of Sperati forgeries (including
tete-beche forgeries) can be found at:
http://www.seymourfamily.com/rfrajola/Sperati/speratiindex.htm
(Richard Frajola). Most of the images shown here have 'SPERATI
REPRODUCTION' in violet printed on the backside together with a
number (of course, Sperati did not sell his forgeries like this,
these marks were applied by the British Philatelic Association).
Source of the distinguishing characteristics: The work of Jean de
Sperati Part IV, 1954 British Philatelic Association. </p>

Reproduction 'A' (zoomed-in from a die-proof).</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'A' has the following distinguishing
characteristics: the 'C' of FRANC' has a long upper tail, there
is a white dot besides the pearls at the height of the chin in
the left hand side of the stamp. There is also a white dot behind
the head and another one near the pearls at the right hand side
(just below the center of the stamp). The following cancels were
used by Sperati:<br>
'LE HAVRE 5E 29 SEPT. 71 (74)'<br>
'MARSEILLES 7E 18 JANV. 71 (12)' (see image above)<br>
and the following numeral dot cancels: '359' (see image above),
'807', '2660' and '3151'. </p>

'Proof' of a Reproduction 'B' of the 2 c value with constant
cancel.</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'B' has a constant cancel 'TOULOUSE
4E 14 JUIN 71' and can thus easily be recognized.</p>

Reproduction 'C'</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'C' is a block of four stamps. It
exists unused or used (with cancel '2145'). The distance between
two stamps is 1.7 mm vertically and 1.8 mm horizontally in the
genuine stamps. The Sperati reproductions are placed 2 mm away
from each other (vertically and horizontally). The upper left
stamp has an extended left leg of the &quot;A&quot; of
&quot;FRANC&quot;. There is a colored dot above the &quot;E&quot;
of &quot;REPUB&quot; in the lower right stamp. Also a cancelled
block with a &quot;LE HAVRE LE PORT 3E 19 DEC 70&quot;.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">4 c Bordeaux issue</h3>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratifor11.jpg"><img
src="franc2/speratifor11.jpg" border="0" width="189" height="223"></a><br>
Sperati reproduction of the 4 c value. This partial dots cancel
is always placed in the same location. Other cancels are placed
in different locations. </p>

Sperati forgery with 'LE HAVRE 3E/9 DEC 70 (74)' cancel</p>

<p align="left">Sperati made two different reproductions of the 4
c value, but both values have the following common distinguishing
characteristics. There is a sink in the outer frameline above the
'AN' of 'FRANC'. The large circle above 'ST' of 'POSTES' is badly
done. The following cancels were applied by Sperati:<br>
'LE HAVRE 3E 9 DEC 70 (74)'<br>
Small numeral dots cancel '1792'<br>
Large numeral dots cancel '1090', '2145', '3219' and partial
cancel (this partical cancel is always in the same position see
image above).</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">20 c Bordeaux issue</h3>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratifor10.jpg"><img
src="franc2/speratifor10.jpg" border="0" width="185" height="217"></a>
<img src="franc2/speratifor_oftype1.jpg" width="184" height="217"></p>

<p align="left">Sperati made a forgery of the rare Type 1 of the
20 c value of the Bordeaux issue. There is a white space in the
background pattern just below to the left of the 'F' of 'FRANC'.
The circle that surrounds the pearls has two breaks: one below
the 'P' of 'REPUB' and another below the 'RA' of 'FRANC'. A white
scratch is coming out of the front of the neck of Ceres. The
pearl that is situated above the 'C' of the left '20 C' has a
rather large white spot to the upper left of it. I have also seen
a die-proof in blue of this forgery. The cancels used by Sperati
on this forgery are: 'BORDEAUX 2E 17 AOUT (X)', 'MILLAU 1 23
AVRIL 71. (41)' and the following numeral cancels (large number):
'359', '822', '861', '918', '1539', '2360' (as shown above),
'3151' and '3171'. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">30 c brown Bordeaux issue</h3>

<p align="left">Two Sperati reproductions exists of the 30 c
value. Several cancels were used on both types:<br>
&quot;BORDEAUX LA BASTIDE 3E 5 AOUT 71&quot;<br>
&quot;BREST FINISTERRE 1E 9 MAI 71&quot;<br>
&quot;LE HAVRE 5E 29 SEPT 71 (74)&quot;<br>
&quot;LE HAVRE LE PORT 3E 19 DEC 70&quot; (see image below)<br>
&quot;MARSEILLES 7E 18 JANV 71 (12)&quot;<br>
&quot;QUIMPER FINISTERRE 2E 26 OCT 71&quot;<br>
Numeral dots cancels: &quot;359&quot;, &quot;807&quot; (see image
below), &quot;822&quot;, &quot;861&quot; (see image below),
&quot;897&quot;, &quot;918&quot;, &quot;1539&quot;,
&quot;1945&quot;, &quot;2145&quot;, &quot;2240&quot;,
&quot;2360&quot;, &quot;2660&quot;, &quot;3151&quot;,
&quot;3171&quot; (see image below), &quot;3219&quot; and
&quot;3539&quot;. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/frasperati6.jpg"><img
src="franc2/frasperati6.jpg" border="0" width="176" height="197"></a><br>
Reproduction 'A' of the 30 c value</p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/typea1.jpg" width="44"
height="45"><br>
Distinguishing characteristic of Reproduction 'A'</p>

<p align="left">The pearls at the right hand side are joined
together in Reproduction 'B'. The lower left cross-ornament has a
white spot on top of it. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratifortypeB1.jpg"><img
src="franc2/speratifortypeB1.jpg" border="0" width="189"
height="219"></a><br>
Reproduction 'B'</p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/typeb1.jpg" width="49"
height="59"><br>
Distinguishing characteristic of Reproduction 'B'.</p>

<p align="left">The pearl shown above is joined to the outer
circle in Reproduction 'B' (this is also a mark of the genuine
stamp of the specific sheet position on which Sperati took based
his forgery). There is a brown color spot above the left '3'.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratifortypeB5.jpg"><img
src="franc2/speratifortypeB5.jpg" border="0" width="186"
height="217"></a> <a href="franc2/speratifortypeB3.jpg"><img

Several cancelled Sperati forgeries</p>

<p align="left">Another 'proof' of Sperati in the value 30 c of
the Bordeaux issue: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="franc2/sperati1.jpg" width="529"
height="665"> <img src="franc2/sperati1b.jpg" width="534"
height="670"><br>
(Sperati 'proof' front and backside)</p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratifortypeB2.jpg"><img
src="franc2/speratifortypeB2.jpg" border="0" width="182"
height="217"></a><br>
Although this cancel 'COMINES 21 JANV 71 (57)' is not mentioned
by the British Philatelic Association, it is a Sperati forgery.
Possibly a genuine bleached out lower value was used to make this
forgery. </p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">80 c Bordeaux issue</h3>

<p align="left">Again two reproductions exist of the 80 c value.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/sotheby_sperati19.jpg"><img
src="franc2/sotheby_sperati19.jpg"
alt="Image obtained from a Sotheby auction" border="0"
width="411" height="411"></a><br>
Reproduction 'A' with constant cancel (left) and Reproduction 'B'
(right)</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'A' always has the same cancel: a
anchor dot cancel with additional 'AS.' in the upper left corner
of the stamp.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="franc2/speratifortypeB6.jpg"><img
src="franc2/speratifortypeB6.jpg" border="0" width="192"
height="221"></a><br>
Sperati Reproduction 'B'(?) of the 80 c</p>

<p align="left">Reproduction 'B' exists cancelled or uncancelled.
On top of the 'C' of 'FRANC' there is a scratch. The following
constant numeral cancels are known: '253', '359' and '3151'.
Although the above forgery is definitively a Sperati forgery (it
has the 'SPERATI REPRODUCTION' mark at the backside), it is not
listed. I'm not sure if it is really Reproduction 'B'. </p>
