<hr>

<p>One of the <a href="gstat.htm">German States</a>. This German
city was conquered by Hamburg and Lubeck in 1420. They governed
it together until 1867, when it became the property of <a
href="gstatham.htm">Hamburg.</a> It was 90 square kilometers
large and had 12,198 inhabitants in 1861.<br>
5 stamps were issued in 1861, all with different sizes, showing
the arms of Hamburg and Lubeck (divided in two halves). The
letters LHPA in the design stand for Lubeck Hamburg Post Amt. On
1 January 1868 the stamps of Bergedorf were no longer valid, the
stamps of the <a href="gstatnor.htm">North German Federation</a>
were used instead. </p>

<h4>1861, Arms of Lubeck and Hamburg, imperforated, the size of
the stamp increases with increasing value</h4>

<p align="left">Source for the number of stamps printed as
mentioned above: 'The Stamps of the German States' by
B.W.H.Poole. <br>
The remainders were bought by a stamp dealer of Brussels (Moens)
in 1867 (300,000 stamps). This accounts for the fact that mint
stamps are much cheaper than used stamps. By the way, Moens also
made enormous amounts of reprints of these stamps (see there). </p>

<p align="left">Tete-beche stamps exist of the values 1 s and 1
1/2 s:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/bergCert1.jpg"><img

height="182"><br>
(I've been told that these tete-beche stamps of the 1 1/2 s value
are genuine)</p>

<p align="left">According to the Michel Spezial Katalog, the
stamp dealer Moens is known to have made 'proofs' of two 1 1/2
Sch stamps, in which one stamp has the inscription 'SCHILLING'
and the other 'SCHILLINGE'. However, other sources (Ewald
Muller-Mark) say that the stamps were discovered in 1869, before
even Moens reported them. He claims it is a printer proof (see
also 'Fakes &amp; Forgeries of Germany &amp; Colonies, No2, 1966,
page 90-91 for a translation of Muller-Mark's article in
English).</p>

<p align="left">The cancel used in Bergedorf consists of a square
of five equi-distant lines. Sometimes the cancel was applied
twice, in which the second strike was applied turned (such that a
cancel as shown above appeared or even a pattern of squares). </p>

<p align="left">Many forged cancels exist. </p>

Essay-reprint in a different design (4 Sch). The original essay
appeared in 1866 as it was believed that the 4 Sch stamp had been
forged in Hamburg. It exists in at least eight different colors
(source: 'The Stamps of the German States' by B.W.H.Poole).</p>

Reprints of the rare non-issued stamps made on the order of Moens
by the Bergedorf authorities. The bar in the 'H' of 'SCHILLING'
is very defective (or even missing) in the 1/2 Sch reprint. The 3
Sch reprint has two black dots in the 'S' of 'POSTMARKE'. </p>

<p>The stamps 1/2 Schilling black on lilac and 3 Schillinge black
on red were printed but came never into use (see pictures of
reprints of these stamps above). The full story on these
'official imiations' can be found in 'The Stamps of the German
States' by B.W.H.Poole.</p>

Reprints of Bergedorf</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">ATTENTION:</font> most of the stamps of
Bergedorf found today are reprints (though forgeries also exist).
Mr. Moens of Brussels obtained the lithographic stones of
Bergedorf and made reprints in 1872, 1874, 1887 and 1888
(according to: 'Philatelic forgers, their lives and works' by
V.E. Tyler). He gave the printing stones of the Bergedorf stamps
to the Berlin Postal Museum (Reichpostmuseum) in 1894 (source:
http://www.berliner-philatelisten-klub-1888.de/hist.htm).
According to 'The Stamps of the German States' by B.W.H.Poole,
Moens also possesed the cancelling device of Bergedorf, which was
also given to the Berlin Postal Museum.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Distinguishing characteristics of reprints:</h4>

<p>'The Forged Stamps of all Countries' by J.Dorn says that the
reprints have many broken lines in the wavy background pattern
and the crossbars of the 'A' and 'H' partially or completely
missing. The following distinguishing characteristics are given
by my 1925 Scott catalogue, the book 'Distinghuishing
Characteristics of Classic Stamps, Old German States' by Herman
Schloss and this website
http://www.philaforum.com/briefmarken/forum/thema6454.htm;
concerning these reprints.</p>

<p><em>1/2 Schilling</em></p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat/bergrep2.jpg" width="218"
height="235"> <a href="gstat3/bergrep1.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/bergrep1.jpg" border="0" width="189" height="184"></a>
<br>
Reprints of 1872 (left) and 1887 (right)</p>

<p><br>
The reprints of the 1/2 Sch has the upper part of the shield
blank. The upper part of the right hand side of the 'N' of 'EIN'
has a dot. The horizontal bar in 'H' of 'HALBER' is often broken.
Specialists distinguish between the 1872 reprint and the 1887
reprint. In the 1887 reprint the eagle head is very faded (see
image above). </p>

<p><em>1 Schilling</em></p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/bergasis9.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/bergasis9.jpg" alt="Probably a reprint." border="0"
width="177" height="179"></a> <a href="gstat/bergrep1.jpg"><em><img
src="gstat/bergrep1.jpg" border="0" width="186" height="175"></em></a>
<br>
(reprints, note the thick '1's in the corners in the second
stamp)</p>

<p><em><br>
</em>The reprints have a broken horizontal bar in the 'A' of
'POSTMARKE'. In the corners, the '1' generally has a foot. There
is a black line between the horizontal central bar of the 'E' of
'EIN' and the vertical bar of this letter. Generally, the
horizontal bar of 'H' of 'SCHILLING' has two black lines
seperating it from the vertical bars. A second reprint was made
with very thick ugly '1's in the corners. Specialists distinguish
between 1872, 1887 and 1888 reprints. The 1887 reprint has the
very thick '1's as shown above. The 1888 reprint has the
background lines printed very weak. </p>

<p><em>1 1/2 Schilling</em></p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat/bergtet1.jpg" width="304"
height="164"><br>
(Even tete-beche stamps were reprinted)</p>

<p>The reprints of the 1 1/2 Sch were made from essays, not from
the actual plates used for postage stamps. They always have the
inscription <strong>SCHILLING</strong><strong><u>E</u></strong>
(with final 'e') which is an easy test. There is also a small
black triangle under the towers (above the 'R' of 'POSTMARKE').
Specialists distinguish between a 1872 and 1887 reprint. </p>

<p>Note: there exists a se-tenant 1 1/2 Sch with and without
final 'E' (so-called Moens 'Korrekturabzug'). <br>
See for more information:
http://www.klassische-philatelie.ch/ad/altdeutsch_bdorf_moens.html.
It is most likely a phantasy product of the stamp dealer Moens of
Brussels. </p>

<p><em>3 Schillinge</em></p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/bergrep10.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/bergrep10.jpg" border="0" width="198" height="196"></a></p>

<p>In the reprints of this value, the head of the eagle doesn't
have any shading. There is a blue line between the horizontal
central bar of the second 'E' of 'BERGEDORF' and the vertical bar
of this letter. Specialists distinguish between 1872, 1887 and
1888 reprints. A coloured dot can be found in the lower half of
the 'S' of 'POSTMARKE' in the 1872 reprint. There is a scratch
line in the 'C' of 'SCHILLINGE' in the 1888 reprint. </p>

<p><em>4 Schillinge</em></p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat/bergrep3.jpg"><em><img
src="gstat/bergrep3.jpg" alt="1872 reprint" border="0"
width="235" height="227"></em></a> <a
href="gstat3/berg74repr.jpg"><img src="gstat3/berg74repr.jpg"
alt="1874 reprint" border="0" width="233" height="236"></a><br>
(Reprints)</p>

<p>For this reprint, the upper part of the shield is not shaded
(or has some very small lines in it). Specialists distinguish
between 1872, 1874 and 1887 reprints). Often, there is a diagonal
thick scratch in the wavy lines at the right side of 'IE' of
'VIER' (1872 and 1887 reprints). A dot can be found in the lower
part of the second 'I' of 'SCHILLING' (for the 1872 and 1887
reprints only). The 'R' and 'G' of 'BERGEDORF' are touching in
the 1872 reprint. In the 1874 reprint, the eagle has a 'horn'.
The 'P' in the lower left corner has the circle above it quite
smudged. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 align="left">Forgeries</h2>

<p>How to detect forgeries? In the genuine stamps there are lines
in the upper part of the shield (except for the 1 Sch, which has
a blank upper part of the shield). More information on forgeries
can be found on Bill Claghorn's forgery site, see:
http://www.geocities.com/claghorn1p/Bergedorf/Berg00.htm. The
genuine stamps should have a perfect pattern of intertwining
circles around the central design. According to 'The Stamps of
the German States' by B.W.H.Poole, the earliest forgeries of the
stamps of Bergedorf already appeared in 1864. </p>

<h4>1/2 Sch. black on blue</h4>

<p>The genuine 1/2 Sch. stamps can be recognized with:<br>
<br>
1. The 'R' of 'HALBER' is broad and flat-topped. <br>
2. The N of EIN does not contain a large dot in its upper right
extremity and the letter is composed of three thick lines. <br>
3. The left tower of the castle is bisected vertically. <br>
4. The cross-bars of all letters A, F and H are intact (or very
nearly so)<br>
5. The paper is blue (there exists a <a href="sperati.htm">Sperati</a>
forgery on white paper, with the 4 above mentioned
characteristics, see image below).</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/sotheby_sperati42.jpg"><img

alt="Sperati forgery, image obtained from a Sotheby auction"
border="0" width="223" height="223"></a><br>
1/2 sch Sperati forgery</p>

<h4>4 Sch</h4>

<p>The genuine 4 Sch has (information obtained from Bill
Claghorn's forgery site and 'Distinghuishing Characteristics of
Classic Stamps, Old German States' by Herman Schloss):</p>

<p>1. A dot in the middle of the 'E' of 'POSTMARKE'<br>
2. There is also a dot below the 'P' of 'POSTMARKE' (below the
frameline)<br>
3. The shading on the griffin's head is uniformly done</p>

Forgery of a reprint? The inscription is &quot;SCHILLINGE&quot;,
but the white part of the shield is much smaller than in the
above reprints. This forgery can also be found in the Fournier
Album (second image with &quot;FAUX&quot; overprint). </p>

<p>Forgeries with irregular circles: </p>

Forgery. This forgery can also be found in the Fournier Album
(second image with &quot;FAUX&quot; overprint). </p>

<p align="left">In the above stamp, the '3's are much larger than
in the genuine stamps. The circular chain pattern is also very
irregular. The head of the eagle is almost touching the chain
pattern above it. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/bergfor20.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/bergfor20.jpg" border="0" width="206" height="209"></a>
<br>
In this forgery of the 3 s, the '3's are much too thin. A similar
image appears in the catalogue of <a href="torres2.htm">Placido
Ramon de Torres</a> &quot;Album Illustrado para Sellos de
Correo&quot; of 1879 (information passed to me thanks to Gerhard

(Forgeries of the 4 Sch)</p>

<p align="left">In the two forgeries above of the 4 s, the chain
pattern has not as many chains as the genuine stamp. Note that
the round window in the lower part of the tower seems to be
absent. </p>

<br>
In this forgery of the 4 s value, the chain pattern is very
irregular, one with a &quot;BERGE.. 7 AUG..&quot; cancel, perhaps
a Fournier cancel? I've been told that the stamp was forged by
the stamp forger <a href="fohl1.htm">Fohl</a> though. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat3/bergfour1.jpg" width="232"
height="129"><br>
The forger <a href="fournier1.htm">Fournier</a> made the above
forged cancel 'BERGEDORF 7 AUG.63' in a box. I do not know where
he used this cancel for. The above cancel was taken from a
'Fournier Album of Philatelic Forgeries'. </p>

A forgery of the 4 Sch value with almost straight lines instead

Strange item with different &quot;1/2&quot; in the corners (image
obtained from Marc Soyer).</p>

<p align="left"><a href="winter.htm">The forger Peter Winter</a>
also made forgeries of these stamps. I know that he made
forgeries of the values 1/2 s, 1 s (pair), 1 1/2 s (pair with one
stamps with final 'E' and without), 1 1/2 s (tete beche pair), 3
s, 4 s and 3+4 s together on piece.</p>

1 1/2 s tete-beche pair, with 'replik' printed on the backside</p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/bergedorfWinter.jpg"><img

1/2 s Peter Winter forgery with &quot;RATZEBURG&quot; cancel as
found in the House of Stamps catalogue. </p>

<p align="left">Winter forgeries also exist with
&quot;BERGEDORF&quot; cancels with several dates &quot;2/11
V&quot; or &quot;8 2 V&quot;. Also with the rare Hamburg
Butterfly cancel ('Schmetterlingstempel').</p>

I've been told that these forgeries were also made by Peter
Winter, they have the inscription 'COPY' on the backside</p>

Very dubious 3 Sch stamps, probably all forgeries. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/bergfor21.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/bergfor21.jpg" border="0" width="193" height="196"></a><br>
Forgery of the 3 Sch with the wavy background pattern much too
coarse. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="gstat3/bergphoto1.jpg"><img
src="gstat3/bergphoto1.jpg" border="0" width="159" height="161"></a><br>
1/2 Sch forgery made from a photograph of a genuine stamp. One
can see the typical 'photgraphical dots' on this reproduction. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat3/bergfor22.jpg" width="180"
height="177"><br>
A forgery of the 3 Sch with the central circular design not
touching the bottom and top inscription labels. Also note the
bogus cancel. </p>

I've been told that this 1/2 Sch red is an essay, I have no
further information. </p>

A 1/2 sch pink stamp, probably a forgery of such an essay.</p>

<p align="left">I know that the forger Julius Goldner (Hamburg,
Germany) made forgeries of the Bergedorf stamps (see 'Philatelic
Forgers, their Lives and Works' by Varro E. Tyler). I have no
further information. If anyone has more information, please
contact me! </p>
