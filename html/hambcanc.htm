<h4>Straight bars ('Strichstempel'):</h4>

(Black and blue bars cancel, I don't know if they are genuine)</p>

<p align="left">According to 'The Stamps of the German States',
by B.W.H.Poole, the genuine cancel should consist of four
parallel lines (either thick or thin), 20 mm long and about 5 mm
apart. Forged cancels exist with too short bars, more than four
bars etc. </p>

<h4 align="left">Wavy lines:</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="gstat2/hamcangen1.jpg" width="180"

(Genuine blue wavy lines cancel; &quot;Wellenstempel von
Ritzebüttel&quot;)</p>

<p align="left">The Ritzebuttel cancel was often applied on the
sheet and then the stamps were pasted on the letters when needed.
Thus there is very often no trace of the cancel on the letters
with this cancel. </p>

<h4 align="left">Butterfly cancel ('Schmetterlingstempel')</h4>

<h4 align="left">Three ring cancel with number
('Dreiringstempel'):</h4>

<p align="left">Three ring cancel with number in the center (the
2 1/2 sch green of the 1864 issue can only be found with this
Danish cancel!):</p>

<p align="left">This cancel was originally used by the two Danish
post offices in Hamburg (Dänisches Oberpostamt). During the war
between Prussia and Denmark these post offices were occupied by
the Prussians. The cancels (numeral cancel 2) were then used on
stamps with destination Denmark or Schleswig-Holstein. There seem
to be two types of this cancel: with slightly smaller and with
slightly larger '2'. Experts are capable of distinghuishing in
which of the two post offices the stamp was cancelled. Source:

<p align="left">A circular cancel with 'HAMBURG' and two stars on
each side was used to cancel remainders (to increase the value of
the stamp). This cancel was only used as an arrival cancel on
envelopes, but never to cancel stamps! So these stamps are
genuine stamps with a fake cancel. In 'Philatelic forgers, their
lives and works' by Varro E. Tyler, we can read that the forger
Julius Goldner obtained these genuine cancels with various dates
of 1866 and 1867 from a post office official in 1868. He then
cancelled remainder Hamburg stamps that he had obtained earlier.
However, the book 'Handbuch der Neudrucke' by Ohrt says on page
348 that these cancels themselves were also forged. According to
Ohrt, the stars in the above forged cancels are much larger. </p>

<p align="left">In the Philatelic Journal of America March 1893,
No 111, page 122, in an article translated from Hugo Krotzsch, it
is said that:<br>
<em>&quot;Cancellation Counterfeits.- We wish again to caution
our readers against the Hamburg cancellation in a simple circle
and between 2 6-rays stars; to all appearance this is a
counterfeit. The best known counterfeit however, is the
&quot;St.P.E.Hamburg'' in a blue double circle, which is found on
the 1/2, 2, 3, 4 and 2 1/2 Schilling; it is usually visible in 3
or 4 parts.Many genuine postage stamps are provided with
counterfeit cancellations, most of them having been manufactured
by </em><em><strong>E. R. Krippner</strong></em><em> of Freiburg
in Saxony. The district attorney of Freiburg has advised us that
these these counterfeit cancellations are to be found on all
values of the first and second\par issue&quot;.<br>
</em>In the book Emil Reinhard Krippner und seine Falsifikate
from Hans Friebe the following four forged cancels of Krippner
are listed (images can also be found there):<br>
1) the Ritzebuttel wavy cancel<br>
2) four bar cancel<br>
3) two ring cancel 'St.P.E.Hamburg 27.VI'<br>
4) two ring cancel 'Hamburg St.P. 31 10 67 2-3N'</p>
