<p>how r u?<br>
I just received you beautiful CD-ROM. Thank you so much! The idea
to use html is extremely intelligent and very very very good. The
quality of the photos is higly improved.<br>
A good work.</p>

<p>Wouaahh, quelle quantité d'information et de timbres scannés
!<br>
<br>
Combien de temps cela t'a pris pour faire tout ça ? Et ce sont
tous des timbres que tu as ou bien que tu as aussi trouvés dans
des catalogues ou sur le net ? I'm impressed. Je vais compulser
tout ça tranquillement, et je suis sur que je vais y trouver des
tonnes d'informations. Par exemple je viens d'aller voir British
East Africa, et je n'avais jamais entendu parler des émissions
de Malakotte et de Witu. Je sens que je vais avoir besoin de mon
gros Atlas mondial... En tout cas, bravo pour ce superbe travail.
Je te ferai part de mes commentaires et questions lorsque j'aurai
plus avancé dans tes CDs. </p>

<p>Dear Evert,<br>
I have received your new CD Cataloque yesterday and it works
perfectly and quickly!! At least my son (7 years) enjoyed it
much. When I have more time, I'll make closer acquaintance with
her and try to modify her with Frontpage. I'll post the old CD
back to you today (to your ducth address) with the money. with
best regards</p>

done a nice job.</p>

<p>Hi Evert!<br>
<br>
It has taken me a while, but I have just started to review your
CD's. &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I first went to the &quot;St.
Vincent&quot; section, since that is my collecting specialties.
&nbsp;&nbsp;I really like the 1pence black issue the red
&quot;K&quot; cancel!<br>
Your CD is very nice and easy to maneuver around in.
&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been contemplating use HTM for doing my CD's
(especially since both Windows and MacIntosh/Apple machine can
read them), but I just don't have the time to mess with HTM right
now, so that is why I'm using the &quot;FlipAlbum&quot; method
(which unfortunately only works Windows...). I hope that you've
had the chance to go through my St. VincentCD..</p>

<p>Dear Evert -<br>
<br>
The CD's arrived several days ago, and I have been too busy to do
more than load them and give them a quick test, but wanted you to
know they got here safely. &nbsp;I look forward to spending more
time with them and thank you for all your hard work creating them
- they are an achievement to be proud of.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi evert!!!<br>
<br>
First of all... THANK YOU!! Thank you very much for sending me
your venezuelan section and for the credit you gave... And by the
way, thanks a lot in the name of all venezuelan philately. You
are doing us a great service spreading the word about our stamps.</p>

<p>Dear Evert,</p>

<p>Thank you for answering my e-mail so promptly. I would like to
get both Cd's. It is a fair price considering all the work you
put into this project and, especially, taking into account the
costs for catalogues.</p>

<p>I do not have too many old stamps from all over the world but
I think your CDs will help me allocate them to the appropriate
country where I cannot identify it for the time being.</p>

<p>What puzzles me is where you got all the pictures from. Don't
tell me you own these stamps. This would make me jealous!!!</p>

<p>Thanks again for everything you did. To my knowledge, you are
the only one who makes such an offer. At least, exploring the
internet I did not find something similar.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to receiving your CD's soon</p>

<p>Hi Evert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the speedy response.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My main interests in Stamp Collecting at
the present time, are Canada, and the Provinces, mint and
used.......Australia and Australian States.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think that I would be much assistance
to you as it appears that your work is far beyond where I am at.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I retired last November. My stamps
had been in storage for the last 25 years, as I had no time for
them, with work and raising a family. Now I am trying to get it
all into albums. I have about 4 to 5 thousand stamps to sort
through......the majority is on paper, so I have my work cut out.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was looking for a colour catalogue on
CD when I came across your web site. Even though yours only goes
to 1920, I believe it would be&nbsp; great asset to any
collector. Once I can find some US money I will send you an
order. I think the banks here in Canada have US money. I will let
you know when I send the letter. <br>
<br>
Thanks again, and the best of luck in all your endeavors<br>
<br>
John G, Canada</p>

<p>Hi Evert,<br>
<br>
They are here and I am extreamly pleased, I have already
identified two stamps from your catalogue that I have been trying
to identify for weeks. Many thanks.<br>

espérences!<br>
Un grand merci,<br>

<p>I received the CD yesterday. Thanks for sending so promptly. I
couldnt believe how quick the shipping was. I have had a quick
look and seems very useful indeed. Keep up the good work. I have
a collection of German states, but I am not an expert and so need
all the help I can get in checking authenticity, especially post
marks.<br>

<p>Thanks, Evert, for your beautiful and utilitarian
catalog.&nbsp; The two CD's arrived in good order on March 2, and
I have been blissfully browsing through them ever since.</p>
